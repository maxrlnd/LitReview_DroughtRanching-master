abstract = {Landscape-scale ecological modelling has been hindered by suitable high-resolution surface meteorological datasets. To overcome these limitations, desirable spatial attributes of gridded climate data are combined with desirable temporal attributes of regional-scale reanalysis and daily gauge-based precipitation to derive a spatially and temporally complete, high-resolution (4-km) gridded dataset of surface meteorological variables required in ecological modelling for the contiguous United States from 1979 to 2010. Validation of the resulting gridded surface meteorological data, using an extensive network of automated weather stations across the western United States, showed skill comparable to that derived from interpolation using station observations, suggesting it can serve as suitable surrogate for landscape-scale ecological modelling across vast unmonitored areas of the United States.

abstract = {Reliable drought monitoring requires long-term and continuous precipitation data. High resolution satellite measurements provide valuable precipitation information on a quasi-global scale. However, their short lengths of records limit their applications in drought monitoring. In addition to this limitation, long-term low resolution satellite-based gauge-adjusted data sets such as the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) one are not available in near real-time form for timely drought monitoring. This study bridges the gap between low resolution long-term satellite gauge-adjusted data and the emerging high resolution satellite precipitation data sets to create a long-term climate data record of droughts. To accomplish this, a Bayesian correction algorithm is used to combine GPCP data with real-time satellite precipitation data sets for drought monitoring and analysis. The results showed that the combined data sets after the Bayesian correction were a significant improvement compared to the uncorrected data. Furthermore, several recent major droughts such as the 2011 Texas, 2010 Amazon and 2010 Horn of Africa droughts were detected in the combined real-time and long-term satellite observations. This highlights the potential application of satellite precipitation data for regional to global drought monitoring. The final product is a real-time data-driven satellite-based standardized precipitation index that can be used for drought monitoring especially over remote and/or ungauged regions.},

abstract = {Sustaining livestock agriculture is important for global food security. Livestock productivity, however, can fluctuate due to many environmental factors, including climate variability. Current predictions of continued warming, decreased precipitation, and increased climate variability worldwide raise serious questions for scientists and producers alike. Foremost is understanding how to mitigate livestock production losses attributed to climate extremes and variability. We investigated the influence of spatial heterogeneity on livestock production over six years in tallgrass prairie of the southern Great Plains, USA. We manipulated heterogeneity by allowing fire and grazing to interact spatially and temporally at broad scales across pastures ranging from 430 to 900. ha. We found that the influence of precipitation on livestock productivity was contingent upon heterogeneity. When heterogeneity was absent, livestock productivity decreased with reduced rainfall. In contrast, when heterogeneity was present, there was no relationship with rainfall and livestock productivity, resulting in heterogeneity stabilizing livestock productivity through time. With predicted increases in climate variability and uncertainty, managing for heterogeneity may assist livestock producers in adapting to climate change and in mitigating livestock productivity loss caused by climatic variability. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Agent-based models (ABMs) are powerful for handling such complexity in CHANS models, facilitating in-depth understanding of CHANS dynamics. ABMs have been employed mostly on a site-specific basis, however. Little of this work provides a common infrastructure with which CHANS researchers (especially nonmodeling experts) can comprehend, compare, and envision CHANS processes and dynamics. We advance the science of CHANS by developing a CHANS-oriented protocol based on the overview, design concepts, and details (ODD) framework to help CHANS modelers and other researchers build, document, and compare CHANS-oriented ABMs. Using this approach, we show how complex demographic decisions, environmental processes, and human–environment interaction in CHANS can be represented and simulated in a relatively straightforward, ...},

Insured corn and soybeans are significantly more sensitive to extreme heat that uninsured crops.

abstract = {The value of public land forage has been of key interest since grazing fees were first established on federal lands. Additionally, knowing the value of rangeland forage is important for assessing the economics of range improvements, grazing systems, and alternative land uses. It is important for resource value compar- isons and impact assessments when public land forage is allocat- ed to other uses. In this synthesis paper, we review the various methods that have been used to value public land forage and dis- cuss the advantages and limitations of each. We highlight that past valuation efforts have concentrated on the value of public land forage for livestock production and, consequently, underes- timated total forage value and rancher willingness to pay for for- age and grazing permits. These research efforts failed to recog- nize that amenity and lifestyle attributes from ranch ownership and forage leasing play important roles in the use and pricing of rangeland forage. We review the numerous studies conducted to estimate public land forage value and suggest modifications to improve future value estimates. Because lifestyle attributes of ranch ownership have so strongly influenced ranch values and what ranchers are willing to pay for grazing use on public lands, we find the market value of federal grazing permits and a modi- fication of the standard contingent valuation method for valuing non-market goods to hold the greatest promise for valuing public land grazing.},

The present experiment sought to explore moral hazard in a laboratory setting. Participants made choices between certain and risky rewards. On some trials, participants bore the full brunt of a loss if the risky reward was chosen and lost. On other trials, participants believed losses would be shared with another party creating the opportunity for moral hazard. Our design allowed us to measure whether the presence of a moral hazard influenced participants' choice behavior and to quantify the magnitude of this influence. Results suggested that participants were more tolerant of risk when they believed losses would be shared with another party compared to choices when all of the loss would be experienced personally. More importantly, concern for the third party losses appeared to exert no influence on choices whatsoever. These results were found when the third party was anonymous (Experiment 1) but also when they met the third party face-to-face (Experiment 2). The relationship between the current results and real-life moral hazards, as well as possible future research directions, is discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Participants also indicated to what extent they used different strategies to prevent or regulate regret. Participants regretted 30{\%} of decisions and forecasted regret in 70{\%} of future decisions, indicating both that regret is relatively prevalent in daily decisions but also that experienced regret was less frequent than forecasted regret. In addition, a number of decision-specific regulation and prevention strategies were successfully used by the participants to minimize regret and negative emotions in daily decision making. Overall, these results suggest that regulation and prevention of regret are important strategies in many of our daily decisions. (PsycINFO Database Record},

abstract = {Lack of access to insurance exacerbates the impact of climate variability on smallholder famers in Africa. Unlike traditional insurance, which compensates proven agricultural losses, weather index insurance (WII) pays out in the event that a weather index is breached. In principle, WII could be provided to farmers throughout Africa. There are two data-related hurdles to this. First, most farmers do not live close enough to a rain gauge with sufficiently long record of observations. Second, mismatches between weather indices and yield may expose farmers to uncompensated losses, and insurers to unfair payouts – a phenomenon known as basis risk. In essence, basis risk results from complexities in the progression from meteorological drought (rainfall deficit) to agricultural drought (low soil moisture). In this study, we use a land-surface model to describe the transition from meteorological to agricultural drought. We demonstrate that spatial and temporal aggregation of rainfall results in a clearer link with soil moisture, and hence a reduction in basis risk. We then use an advanced statistical method to show how optimal aggregation of satellite-based rainfall estimates can reduce basis risk, enabling remotely sensed data to be utilized robustly for WII.},

abstract = {Climate change is projected to increase flood risks in certain regions due to an increase in both precipitation and sea level rise. In addition, socio-economic scenarios project an increase in urbanization in flood prone areas, which results in a higher damage potential. The combined effect of climate and land use change on flood risks requires innovative adaptation policies to cope with rising risks. Increasingly, attention is paid to the role insurance can play in mitigating damage by providing incentives to policyholders to undertake damage reducing measures. The willingness of homeowners in the Netherlands to undertake measures that mitigate flood damage in exchange for benefits on hypothetical flood insurance policies is examined using surveys. The results indicate that many homeowners are willing to make investments in mitigation. In particular, approximately two-thirds are willing to invest in water barriers in exchange for a premium reduction and about a fifth are willing to replace floor types that are vulnerable to flooding with water resistant floor types. Furthermore, about a quarter are willing to move central heating installations to floors safe against flooding in favor of a reduction in the insurance premium. Estimates of the effectiveness of these mitigation measures to limit potential flood damage in the river delta indicate that prevented damage could be substantial, namely in the order of 1 billion euro or larger. Reductions in (absolute) flood risk due to mitigation are especially large under climate change. A probit model indicates that existing arrangements for compensating flood damage, risk awareness and perceptions, and geographical characteristics are important determinants in the decision to undertake mitigation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In spite of overwhelming experimental evidence to the contrary, rotational grazing continues to be promoted and implemented as the only viable grazing strategy. The goals of this synthesis are to 1) reevaluate the complexity, underlying assumptions, and ecological processes of grazed ecosystems, 2) summarize plant and animal production responses to rotational and continuous grazing, 3) characterize the prevailing perceptions influencing the assessment of rotational and continuous grazing, and 4) attempt to direct the profession toward a reconciliation of perceptions advocating support for rotational grazing systems with that of the experimental evidence. The ecological relationships of grazing systems have been reasonably well resolved, at the scales investigated, and a continuation of costly grazing experiments adhering to conventional research protocols will yield little additional information. Plant production was equal or greater in continuous compared to rotational grazing in 87{\%} (20 of 23) of the experiments. Similarly, animal production per head and per area were equal or greater in continuous compared to rotational grazing in 92{\%} (35 of 38) and 84{\%} (27 of 32) of the experiments, respectively. These experimental data demonstrate that a set of potentially effective grazing strategies exist, none of which have unique properties that set one apart from the other in terms of ecological effectiveness. The performance of rangeland grazing strategies are similarly constrained by several ecological variables establishing that differences among them are dependent on the effectiveness of management models, rather than the occurrence of unique ecological phenomena. Continued advocacy for rotational grazing as a superior strategy of grazing on rangelands is founded on perception and anecdotal interpretations, rather than an objective assessment of the vast experimental evidence. We recommend that these evidence-based conclusions be explicitly incorporated into management and policy decisions addressing this predominant land use on rangelands.},

abstract = {This article synthesizes the ecological concepts and perspectives underpinning the development and application of state-and-transition models, thresholds, and rangeland health. Introduction of the multiple stable state concept paved the way for the development of these alternative evaluation procedures by hypothesizing that multiple stable plant communities can potentially occupy individual ecological sites. Vegetation evaluation procedures must be able to assess continuous and reversible as well as discontinuous and nonreversible vegetation dynamics because both patterns occur and neither pattern alone provides a complete assessment of vegetation dynamics on all rangelands. Continuous and reversible vegetation dynamics prevail within stable vegetation states, whereas discontinuous and nonreversible dynamics occur when thresholds are surpassed and one stable state replaces another. State-and-transition models can accommodate both categories of vegetation dynamics because they represent vegetation change along several axes, including fire regimes, weather variability and management prescriptions in addition to the succession-grazing axis associated with the traditional range model. Ecological thresholds have become a focal point of state-and-transition models because threshold identification is necessary for recognition of the various stable plant communities than can potentially occupy an ecological site. Thresholds are difficult to define and quantify because they represent a complex series of interacting components, rather than discrete boundaries in time and space. Threshold components can be categorized broadly as structural and functional based on compositional and spatial vegetation attributes and on modification of ecosystem processes, respectively. State-and-transition models and rangeland health procedures have developed in parallel, rather than as components of an integrated framework, because the two procedures primarily rely on structural and functional thresholds, respectively. It may be prudent for rangeland professionals to consider the introduction of these alternative evaluation procedures as the beginning of a long-term developmental pocess, rather than as an end point marked by the adoption of an alternative set of standardized evaluation procedures.},

abstract = {Heat stress in cattle results in millions of dollars in lost revenue each year due to production losses, and in extreme cases, death. Death losses are more likely to result from animals vulnerable to heat stress. A study was conducted to determine risk factors for heat stress in feedlot heifers. Over two consecutive summers, a total of 256 feedlot heifers (32/ breed/ year) of four breeds were observed. As a measure of stress, respiration rates and panting scores were taken twice daily (morning and afternoon) on a random sample of 10 heifers/ breed. Weights, condition scores, and temperament scores were taken on 28-day intervals during the experiment. Health history from birth to slaughter was available for every animal used in this study. It was found that at temperatures above 25????C, dark-hided animals were 25{\%} more stressed than light-colored; a history of respiratory pneumonia increased stress level by 10.5{\%}; each level of fatness increased stress level by approximately 10{\%}; and excitable animals had a 3.2{\%} higher stress level than calm animals. Not only did the stress level increase with these risk factors, but average daily gain was reduced. The Charolais cattle gained significantly more than all other breeds of cattle tested. Calm cattle gained 5{\%} more than excitable cattle. Finally, cattle treated for pneumonia gained approximately 8{\%} slower than non-treated cattle. The results of this study have not only revealed heat stress risk factors of breed (color), condition score (fatness), temperament, and health history (treated or not treated for pneumonia), but have also shown the effectiveness of using respiration rate as an indicator of heat stress. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Heat stress in feedlot cattle can cause decreases in feed intake and growth, and in extreme cases may result in death. Providing shade during hot weather has shown inconsistent results, reducing direct and indirect losses in some areas of the United States, but not in others. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the dynamic responses of feedlot cattle to environmental conditions with and without access to shade, and to determine the most appropriate physiological measurement for monitoring feedlot cattle during hot weather as a guide for improved management. Eight crossbred steers (initially weighing 294.7??10.8 kg) were randomly assigned to one of eight individual pens, where one of two treatments were applied: shade access, or no-shade access. Respiration rate, daily feed intake, and core body temperature were collected, using automated systems during eight periods, for a total of 37 days. The data were analysed using four categories of daily maximum temperature humidity index (maximum ITH) values (Normal for maximum I TH {\textless}74; alert for 74??? maximum ITH{\textless}78; Danger for 78???maximum ITH{\textless}84; Emergency for maximum ITH???84). Shade was found to impact the physiological responses in all ITH categories, with the largest impacts in the Danger and Emergency categories. Shade lowered respiration rate and core body temperature during the peak temperature hours of the day. It was concluded that respiration rate is the most appropriate indicator of thermal stress to monitor because it was consistently affected in all ITH categories, it is easy to monitor without the need for costly equipment, and there is little or no lag associated with it.},

abstract = {Exposure of livestock grazing to forage productivity variation and to market fluctuations affects the risk of investment and returns from cow-calf operations, but little work has been done to empirically compare these returns to the returns that would be demanded by financial markets from assets with similar risk and return characteristics. This study uses historical forage production data from three rangeland locations in California, and cattle and hay prices, to simulate financial statements for three hypothetical cow-calf producers in the period 1988–2007. Return on investment from year to year incorporates the variability and risk associated with dependence on natural forage production. Performance is then compared to the actual performance of a diversified portfolio of assets using the Capital Asset Pricing Model, from which the theoretical cost of capital for these hypothetical grazing enterprises is derived. Much like other agricultural enterprises, cow-calf production in California has low market risk and a low theoretical cost of capital. This theoretical cost of capital is still greater than the historical return from livestock production (excluding land appreciation) in the western United States, adding further backing to the point often made in the literature that ranchers who engage in cow-calf production are receiving benefits beyond the commercial returns from livestock production alone.},

We built a network of cattle movement from a state-stratified 10{\%} systematic sample of calendar year 2009 Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) data. ICVIs are required to certify the apparent health of cattle moving across state borders and allow us to examine cattle movements at the county scale. The majority of the ICVI sample consisted of small ship-ments ({\textless}20 head) moved for feeding and beef production. Geographically, the central plains states had the most connections, correlated to feeding infrastructure. The entire nation was closely connected when interstate movements were summarized at the state level. At the county-level, the U.S. is still well connected geographically, but significant heterogeneities in the location and identity of counties central to the network emerge. Overall, the network of interstate movements is described by a hub structure, with a few counties sending or receiving extremely large numbers of shipments and many counties sending and receiv-ing few shipments. The county-level network also has a very low proportion of reciprocal movements, indicating that high-order network properties may be better at describing a county's importance than simple summaries of the number of shipments or animals sent and received. We suggest that summarizing cattle movements at the state level homoge-nizes the network and a county level approach is most appropriate for examining processes influenced by cattle shipments, such as economic analyses and disease outbreaks.},

The moderate-risk scenario was average rainfall-average price. The 2 high-risk scenarios were unfavorable rain-fall-optimistic price and unfavorable rainfall-pessimistic price. The highest net returns from the low-risk and moderate-risk scenar-ios were obtained at the high stocking rate with sales in September and October. The highest net returns from the high-risk scenarios were obtained at the moderate stocking rate with sales in September and October. Risk-averse operators who are not prepared to handle sales before October will be better off using a low stocking rate. Risk-taker operators will obtain higher net returns than risk-averse operators using a high stocking rate providing they are prepared to sell half of the herd in July if cumulative rainfall up to June is below 149 mm. If this high stocking rate is maintained beyond July, operators should sell in September independently of the amount of rainfall or the level of prices in August.},

abstract = {Data on associations between weather conditions and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) morbidity in autumn-placed feedlot cattle are sparse. The goal of our study was to quantify how different weather variables during corresponding lag periods (considering up to 7 d before the day of disease measure) were associated with daily BRD incidence during the first 45 d of the feeding period based on a post hoc analysis of existing feedlot operational data. Our study population included 1,904 cohorts of feeder cattle (representing 288,388 total cattle) that arrived to 9 US commercial feedlots during September to November in 2005 to 2007. There were 24,947 total cases of initial respiratory disease (animals diagnosed by the feedlots with BRD and subsequently treated with an antimicrobial). The mean number of BRD cases during the study period (the first 45 d after arrival) was 0.3 cases per day per cohort (range = 0 to 53.0), and cumulative BRD incidence risks ranged from 0 to 36{\%} within cattle cohorts. Data were analyzed with a multivariable mixed-effects binomial regression model. Results indicate that several weather factors (maximum wind speed, mean wind chill temperature, and temperature change in different lag periods) were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) associated with increased daily BRD incidence, but their effects depended on several cattle demographic factors (month of arrival, BRD risk code, BW class, and cohort size). In addition, month and year of arrival, sex of the cohort, days on feed, mean BW of the cohort at entry, predicted BRD risk designation of the cohort (high or low risk), cohort size, and the interaction between BRD risk code and arrival year were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) associated with daily BRD incidence. Our results demonstrate that weather conditions are significantly associated with BRD risk in populations of feedlot cattle. Defining these conditions for specific cattle populations may enable cattle health managers to predict and potentially manage these effects more effectively; further, estimates of effects may contribute to the development of quantitative predictive models for this important disease syndrome.},

@article{Clary2000,
abstract = {Stubble height, a measure of the herbaceous vegetation remaining after grazing, has been widely used in recent years to gage the impacts of grazing use in riparian areas. Stubble height is a short-term management guide that should only be applied to help attain long-term ecological objectives; it should not be thought of as a long-term management objective.Maintaining a minimum stubble height helps preserve forage plant vigor, retain sufficient forage to reduce cattle browsing of willows (Salix spp.), stabilize sediments, indirectly limit streambank trampling, maintain cattle gains, and provide an easily communicated management criterion. Based on limited specific research of riparian system response and on knowledge of the characteristics of how cattle graze, a 10-cm residual stubble height is recommended by the authors as a starting point for improved riparian grazing management. Monitoring should then be conducted to determine if an adjustment is needed. In some situations, 7 cm or even less stubble height may provide for adequate riparian ecosystem function, particularly when streambanks are dry and stable or possibly at high elevations where vegetation is naturally of low stature. In other situations, 15-20 cm of stubble height may be required to reduce browsing of willows or limit trampling impact to vulnerable streambanks. The recommended criterion would apply to streamside and nearby meadow sites with hydrophilic or potentially hydrophilic vegetation, but not directly to dry meadows or even to all wet meadows. Stubble height may have little application where the streambanks are stabilized by coarse substrates, or the channels are deeply incised.The effects of residual stubble height in riparian functions have received limited direct experimental examination. Consequently, much of the information in this review was derived from studies indirectly related to the questions raised and, to some extent, from observations of experienced professionals. The authors have identified areas of scientific investigation needed to improve our understanding of the effects of stubble height on riparian function and grazing management.},

The proposed flexible design is a generic framework that uses Growing Degree Days to determine annual variable start and end dates for the insured period. This approach reflects the progress of phenological plant growth phases more accurately than fixed periods and hence is expected to reduce the basis risk of the index insurance. In addition, we develop an economic framework that focuses on the role of downside risks and apply Quantile Regression to tailor optimal insurance specifications. This framework is then used to compare the downside risks associated with the use of flexible and fixed insurance periods. The results show that the introduction of flexibility in the index design leads to a reduction in farmers' downside risk exposure and to a more efficient contract design.},

abstract = {In the Southwest and Central Plains of Western North America, climate change is expected to increase drought severity in the coming decades. These regions nevertheless experienced extended Medieval-era droughts that were more persistent than any historical event, providing crucial targets in the paleoclimate record for bench-marking the severity of future drought risks. We use an empirical drought reconstruction and three soil moisture metrics from 17 state-of-the-art general circulation models to show that these models project significantly drier conditions in the later half of the 21st century compared to the 20th century and earlier paleoclimatic intervals. This desiccation is consistent across most of the models and moisture balance variables, indicating a coherent and robust drying response to warming despite the diversity of models and metrics analyzed. Notably, future drought risk will likely exceed even the driest centuries of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1100–1300 CE) in both moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) future emissions scenarios, leading to unprecedented drought conditions during the last millennium.},

The results of the experiment indicate that 1) the REM is both a reliable and valid measure of regret and 2) decision behavior can be better understood when both outcome feedback and regret resulting from that feedback (or the lack of feedback) are considered.

Analyses of model-simulated soil moisture(3,4), drought indices(1,5,6) and precipitation-minus-evaporation(7) suggest increased risk of drought in the twenty-first century. There are, however, large differences in the observed and model-simulated drying patterns(1,2,6). Reconciling these differences is necessary before the model predictions can be trusted. Previous studies(8-12) show that changes in sea surface temperatures have large influences on land precipitation and the inability of the coupled models to reproduce many observed regional precipitation changes is linked to the lack of the observed, largely natural change patterns in sea surface temperatures in coupled model simulations(13). Here I show that the models reproduce not only the influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation on drought over land, but also the observed global mean aridity trend from 1923 to 2010. Regional differences in observed and model-simulated aridity changes result mainly from natural variations in tropical sea surface temperatures that are often not captured by the coupled models. The unforced natural variations vary among model runs owing to different initial conditions and thus are irreproducible. I conclude that the observed global aridity changes up to 2010 are consistent with model predictions, which suggest severe and widespread droughts in the next 30-90 years over many land areas resulting from either decreased precipitation and/or increased evaporation.},

abstract = {Weather index insurance is being offered to low-income farmers in developing countries as an alternative to traditional multi-peril crop insurance. There is widespread support for index insurance as a means of climate change adaptation but whether or not these products are themselves resilient to climate change has not been well studied. Given climate variability and climate change, an over-reliance on historical climate observations to guide the design of such products can result in premiums which mislead policyholders and insurers alike, about the magnitude of underlying risks. Here, a method to incorporate different sources of climate data into the product design phase is presented. Bayesian Networks are constructed to demonstrate how insurers can assess the product viability from a climate perspective, using past observations and simulations of future climate. Sensitivity analyses illustrate the dependence of pricing decisions on both the choice of information, and the method for incorporating such data. The methods and their sensitivities are illustrated using a case study analysing the provision of index-based crop insurance in Kolhapur, India. We expose the benefits and limitations of the Bayesian Network approach, weather index insurance as an adaptation measure and climate simulations as a source of quantitative predictive information. Current climate model output is shown to be of limited value and difficult to use by index insurance practitioners. The method presented, however, is shown to be an effective tool for testing pricing assumptions and could feasibly be employed in the future to incorporate multiple sources of climate data. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

Surprisingly, the use of remote sensing in claim-based insurance appears to be instigated by government rather than the insurance industry. In contrast, insurance companies are offering various index insurance products that are based on remote sensing. For example, remotely sensed index insurance for rangelands and livestock are operational, while various applications in crop index insurance are being considered or under development. The paper discusses these differences and concludes that there is particular scope for application of remote sensing by the insurance industry in index insurance because (1) indices can be constructed that correlate well with what is insured; (2) these indices can be delivered at low cost; and (3) it opens up new markets that are not served by claim-based insurance. The paper finally suggests that limited adoption of remote sensing in insurance results from a lack of mutual understanding and calls for greater cooperation between the insurance industry and the remote sensing community.},

abstract = {PHYGROW, a hydrologic-based forage simulation model, was parameterized to represent a typical South Texas ranch engaged in the production of cattle and meat goats with an indigenous population of white-tailed deer. Forage production and associated stocking rates for two cattle: goat ratios were simulated for 20 years. Two, ten-year weather scenarios, one representing normal conditions (30{\%} drought years) and one representing dryer weather conditions (50{\%} drought years) were analyzed. Management decision rules were developed for the region to produce estimates of annual animal production and operating cost for the enterprises in each of the four scenarios. These performance and cost data were then used as input into FLIPSIM, a firm level income and policy simulator, along with relevant product and input price data for the region. Integration of modeled results produced useful information showing the socioeconomic consequences for a typical South Texas firm impacted by alternative climatic conditions and management strategies. INTRODUCTION Over the past half-century a large number of issues related to human use of grazinglands have been analyzed. Many of these analyses, however, have failed to provide the reliability, robustness and usefulness for managers and policy makers that similar efforts directed at agronomic production have produced (Bernardo and Conner, 1990). Several factors contribute to this analytical difficulty including the complexity of a system where the product of interest comes from herbivores using grazed forages; the heterogeneity of range ecosystems; the adverse and highly variable climatic conditions associated with rangelands; and the difficulty in understanding the underlying ecological forces that govern grazingland productivity. Conner (1994) suggested that assessing the socioeconomic impacts of change (technological, institutional or environmental) on grazinglands could be accomplished using a procedure whereby a region is characterized by modeling a set of representative farms using the output of a plant growth model as input to an animal production model, then using the output from the animal model as input to a firm level economic performance model. The study reported herein was undertaken to determine the feasibility of this proposed procedure. METHODS Data for a typical South Texas ranch were used to parameterize PHYGROW (RSG, 1995) as described in a companion paper (ID No. 1387) prepared for presentation at this Congress (Stuth et al. 1997). Two cattle:goat ratios, 70:30 and 50:50, were selected to represent alternative management strategies available to a firm operator. Twenty years of simulated forage production and associated stocking rates from PHYGROW were divided into two ten-year periods one representing a normal climatic scenario with about 30{\%} drought years and the other representing a dryer climatic scenario with about 50{\%} drought years. Drought years were defined as those in which the stocking rate output from PHYGROW was less than},

abstract = {Several studies have projected increases in drought severity, extent and duration in many parts of the world under climate change. We examine sources of uncertainty arising from the methodological choices for the assessment of future drought risk in the continental US (CONUS). One such uncertainty is in the climate models' expression of evaporative demand (E 0), which is not a direct climate model output but has been traditionally estimated using several different formulations. Here we analyze daily output from two CMIP5 GCMs to eval-uate how differences in E 0 formulation, treatment of meteorological driving data, choice of GCM, and standardization of time series influence the estimation of E 0 . These methodologi-cal choices yield different assessments of spatio-temporal variability in E 0 and different trends in 21 st century drought risk. First, we estimate E 0 using three widely used E 0 formula-tions: Penman-Monteith; Hargreaves-Samani; and Priestley-Taylor. Our analysis, which pri-marily focuses on the May-September warm-season period, shows that E 0 climatology and its spatial pattern differ substantially between these three formulations. Overall, we find higher magnitudes of E 0 and its interannual variability using Penman-Monteith, in particular for regions like the Great Plains and southwestern US where E 0 is strongly influenced by variations in wind and relative humidity. When examining projected changes in E 0 during the 21 st century, there are also large differences among the three formulations, particularly the},

We parameterized the model to represent a region of extensive cow-calf production in the northeastern portion of the Mexican state of Coahuila, and evaluated animal performance (animal body condition, cow mortality, and calf production) and range condition resulting from each strategy under random precipitation conditions typical of the region. To evaluate the validity of the randomly generated precipitation, we conducted the simulations under an historical (1950-1994) precipitation regime. The five management strategies included one with no adjustments to stocking rate (CONTROL, most common current practice), one with stocking rate adjustment rules based on changes in animal body condition (BCS), and three with different stocking rate adjustment rules based on various comparisons of recent-year precipitation with long-term mean precipitation during the growing season (March-November) (REPLA, PPT 1Y, PPT 2Y). Each strategy was evaluated at each of three initial base-level stock cow stocking rates (125, 250 and 500 AUY {\textperiodcentered} 5000 ha-1). Stocking rate adjustments consisted of partial or total de-stocking, with the re-establishment, or not, of the initial number of stock cows before the beginning of the subsequent breeding season. Results of 45-year simulations under both random and historical precipitation suggest CONTROL and PPT 2Y (based on comparison of current year and previous year precipitation with the long-term mean) strategies, combined with the high base-level stocking rate, are the worst and best, respectively. Under the historical precipitation regime, in the last period of time simulated (1980-1994) these two strategies resulted, respectively, in poor (0.5) versus good range condition (1.0), animal body condition scores of 2.6 versus 5.2, annual cow mortalities of 76 versus 5{\%}, and calf production rates of 0.9 versus 10.6 kg ha-1 year-1 at weaning. The PPT 1Y strategy (based on comparison of current year precipitation with the long-term mean) produced results fairly similar to PPT 2Y, with BCS and REPLA strategies producing results intermediate between CONTROL and PPT 2Y. Our results suggest it is advantageous to adjust stocking rates based on precipitation during the current growing season since it improves cattle production without damaging range condition. Considering the practical feasibility of the strategies, we recommend the PPT 1Y strategy because it maintains range condition at moderate stocking rates, results in good animal performance and does not require total de-stocking of the ranch. The simple method we developed to stochastically generate monthly precipitation produces a time series of precipitation values that were representative of general historical precipitation patterns and provided realistic levels of uncertainty in simulated forage production to evaluate alternative management strategies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A simple ecological sustainability simulator (SESS) for stocking rate management on semi-arid grazinglands, 76, 655] for rangelands with mean annual precipitation of 500 mm to evaluate tendencies in range productivity and cattle production under four management options: (1) supplemental feeding, (2) short-term reduction of stocking rate, (3) early weaning, and (4) adjustment of breeding seasons. We have made five modifications to SESS for the present paper. (1) Cattle mortality now occurs each month as a function of body condition. (2) Cows that are not pregnant 2 months after the end of the breeding season are sold. (3) Forage intake is calculated separately for each cohort of cows. (4) Cows that have been sold or have died are replaced just before the beginning of each breeding season (except for the short-term reduction of stocking rate strategy). (5) The calculation of stocking rate now includes cows, bulls, nursing calves, weaned heifers less than 20 months of age, and pre-reproductive heifers aged 20 months or older. Simulation results suggest the four management options might be ranked from best to worst, in terms of increasing cattle production while maintaining range productivity, as: (1) short-term reduction of stocking rate, (2) adjustment of breeding seasons, (3) early weaning, and (4) supplementation. Short-term reduction of high stocking rates reduces the deterioration of range productivity because of the reduction in the number of stock. Adjustment of breeding seasons such that periods of highest energy requirements of cows and calves coincide with periods of highest forage production increases percentage pregnancy. Early weaning of calves improves the body condition of cows and increases annual production of weaned calves, but does not reduce the stocking rate and thus does not improve range productivity. Supplemental feeding, and other management practices that artificially sustain herbivores, break the negative feedback that promotes good range productivity and maintains long-term system stability. In general, strategies to increase cattle production in semi-arid rangelands should be based on the improvement of natural forage production. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Equations were written to estimate annual net primary production based on range condition, annual precipitation, and soil characteristics typical of the region. Simulations were conducted for annual precipitation levels of 300, 500, and 700 mm to estimate total and green standing crop dynamics, cattle grazing efficiency, and range condition trend for different stocking rates. The model-estimated stocking rates to achieve stable or slight improvement of range condition for the three precipitation levels were close to 58, 15, and 6 ha per animal-unit-year (AUY), respectively. With the model parameterized for precipitation and soil characteristics combined with the stocking rates recommended by COTECOCA (1979. Coahuila.

The trends of body condition score and range condition for years 5, 10, 15, and 20 were similar within each of the three groups. The stocking rates recommended by COTECOCA were too high for sustainability on range site groups with 270 and 351 mm annual precipitation. The simulated probabilities for pregnancy rates at different stocking rates for the three groups indicated that the stocking rates recommended by COTECOCA were too high to achieve pregnancy rates ≥80{\%} in 8 out of 10 years with no supplement in the form of hay or concentrated feeds. Model simulations suggested that, in the absence of supplemental feed, ecological sustainability and acceptable livestock production could be achieved simultaneously at light stocking rates. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Future challenges in drought assessment as influenced by democratization are also considered. We conclude that meteorological methods have several inherent deficiencies which render them risky for the optimum allocation of drought relief. Agricultural drought assessment is suggested to be more preferable. Current agricultural drought models should nevertheless be improved to deal more successfully with the dynamic nature of rangeland. Evidence indicates that no absolute objective biophysical criteria for the quantification of the onset and the end of a drought have been identified and that all current criteria have an inherent subjectivity. Choosing appropriate interpolation techniques for mapping drought extent is a cause for concern, and there is scope for future research. Remote sensing techniques, integrated with crop modelling techniques, are options to pursue further. We finally suggest that in a democratic South Africa, more attention should be given to a multi-disciplinary approach where impacts, other than meteorological and agricultural, on previously disadvantaged black farmers are also assessed.},

abstract = {The U.S. crop insurance market has several features that set it apart from other insurance markets. These include explicit government subsidies with an average premium subsidy rate of about 60{\%} in recent years, and the legislative requirement that premium rates be set at actuarially fair levels, where the federal government sets rates and pays all costs related to insurance policy sales and ser-vices. Bearing these features in mind, we examine the extent to which farmers' crop insurance choices conform to economic theory. A standard expected utility maximization framework is con-structed to analyze trade-offs between higher risk protection and larger subsidy payments. We de-compose the effect of coverage level on expected utility into insurance, premium loading, and subsidy transfer effects where the loading effect vanishes if rates are actuarially fair. Given an actuar-ially fair premium, we infer that a rational farmer should choose either the coverage level with the highest premium subsidy or a higher coverage level. Evidence from a large insurance unit-level data-set contradicts this theoretical inference, and so suggests anomalous insurance decisions. In a novel application of the mixed logit framework, we show that the probability an insurance product is cho-sen declines as out-of-pocket premium expenditures increase, even though higher values of these ex-penditures should reflect improved grower welfare. Premium expenditures appear to be more salient than the uncertain future benefits they support. We apply our regression to the recent trend yield ad-justment innovation in crop insurance.},

abstract = {Conventional wisdom among rangeland professionals has been that for long-term sustainability of grazing livestock operations, rangeland should be kept in high good to low excellent range condition. Our objective was to analyze production parameters, costs, returns, and profit using data generated over a 34-yr period (1969–2002) from grazing a Clayey range site in the mixed- grass prairie of western South Dakota with variable stocking rates to maintain pastures in low–fair, good, and excellent range condition classes. Cattle weights were measured at turnout and at the end of the grazing season. Gross income ? ha21 was the product of gain ? ha21 and price. Prices were based on historical National Agricultural Statistics Services feeder cattle prices. Annual variable costs were estimated using a yearling cattle budget developed by South Dakota State University agricultural economists. All economic values were adjusted to a constant dollar using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index. Stocking rate, average daily gain, total gain, net profit, gross revenue, and annual costs ? ha21 varied among range condition classes. Net income for low–fair range condition ({\$}27.61 ? ha21) and good range condition ({\$}29.43 ? ha21) were not different, but both were greater than excellent range condition ({\$}23.01 ? ha21). Over the life of the study, real profit (adjusted for inflation) steadily increased for the low–fair and good treatments, whereas it remained level for the excellent treatment. Neither drought nor wet springs impacted profit differently for the three treatments. These results support generally observed rancher behavior regarding range condition: to maintain their rangeland in lower range condition than would be recommended by rangeland professionals. Ecosystem goods and services of increasing interest to society and associated with high range condition, such as floristic diversity, hydrologic function, and some species of wildlife, come at an opportunity cost to the rancher.},

abstract = {For ranchers in the Southwest, unanticipated droughts pose serious management challenges. Social and economic factors combine with the physical impacts of drought to render ranchers more vulnerable to climate variability. Using agricultural census data and interviews with ranchers, we analyze ranchers' responses to drought events in 1996 and 1999. From this analysis we develop an initial assessment of the principal factors contributing to the vulnerability of ranching in southeastern Arizona to climatic variability, and we make some preliminary determinations regarding the potential use of climate information in mitigating this vulnerability. During drought, climatic conditions can combine with poor cattle prices and high feed costs to strain ranchers' resources. The ability to cope with drought is further complicated by changes in environmental policy and pressure from urban growth. In these circumstances, ranchers reported being tempted to sell their private ranch property to development interests. Although our pilot study identified smaller operations as the most vulnerable to climatic variability in the context of policy and economic uncertainty, these operations reported less utility in climate information. The multidimensional nature of vulnerability suggests that climate information will be most useful to ranching operations of all sizes if it is integrated with market, policy and other economic information and if existing information distribution channels are used to reach ranchers.},

abstract = {African pastoral ecosystems have been studied with the assumptions that these ecosystems are potentially stable (equilibrial) systems which become destabilized by overstocking and overgrazing. Development policy in these regions has focused on internal alterations of system structure, with the goals of restoring equilibrium and increasing productivity. Nine years of ecosystem-level research in northern Kenya presents a view of pastoral ecosystems that are non-equilibrial but persistent, with system dynamics affected ore by abiotic than biotic controls. Development practices that fail to recognize these dynamics may result in increased deprivation and failure. Pastoral ecosystems may be better supported by development policies that build on and facilitate the traditional pastoral strategies rather than constrain them.},

abstract = {This project assessed the impact that the 2012 drought had on northwest Iowa cow-calf operations. A survey was mailed to 293 beef producers in seventeen northwest Iowa counties. Producers indicated that feed resources were scarce, and those who bought feed noted high prices made feed an undesirable purchase. Future plans included extensive pasture management and feed supplementation. The average pregnancy rate of the females, 93{\%}, was not significantly affected by the drought, but heat stress on the female was perceived to affect pregnancy rate. Despite drought, 11{\%} of the producers planned to retain open females. The majority, 75{\%}, of the operations indicated that drought had little impact on their financial position, but 25{\%} responded that their financial position would be poorer. To cope, some producers would sell part of the cows, sell the 2012 calves, and/or sell the 2012 replacement heifers. Other producers indicated that total or partial dispersal of the herd may be required. Rain, availability of feeds, and price of feedstuffs would dictate whether they kept or sold calves and cows.

Current indicators suffer from deficiencies including temporal inconsistency, and statistical incomparability. Different indicators have varying scales and ranges and their values cannot be compared with each other directly. Most drought indicators rely on a representative parametric probability distribution function that fits the data. However, a parametric distribution function may not fit the data, especially in continental/global scale studies. SDAT is based on a nonparametric framework that can be applied to different climatic variables including precipitation, soil moisture and relative humidity, without having to assume representative parametric distributions. The most attractive feature of the framework is that it leads to statistically consistent drought indicators based on different variables.},

Changes in rainfall patterns predicted by global climate models for the central United States are expected to cause lower and increasingly variable soil water availability, which may impact net primary production and plant species composition in native Great Plains grasslands. We experimentally altered the timing and quantity of growing season rainfall inputs by lengthening inter-rainfall dry intervals by 50{\%}, reducing rainfall quantities by 30{\%}, or both, compared to the ambient rainfall regime in a native tallgrass prairie ecosystem in northeastern Kansas. Over three growing seasons, increased rainfall variability caused by altered rainfall timing with no change in total rainfall quantity led to lower and more variable soil water content (0–30 cm depth), a ∼10{\%} reduction in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), increased root to shoot ratios, and greater canopy photon flux density at 30 cm above the soil surface. Lower total ANPP primarily resulted from reduced growth, biomass and flowering of subdominant warm-season C4 grasses while productivity of the dominant C4 grass Andropogon gerardii was relatively unresponsive. In general, vegetation responses to increased soil water content variability were at least equal to those caused by imposing a 30{\%} reduction in rainfall quantity without altering the timing of rainfall inputs. Reduced ANPP most likely resulted from direct effects of soil moisture deficits on root activity, plant water status, and photosynthesis.

The ecological costs of this nearly ubiqui- tous form of land use can be dramatic. Examples of such costs include loss of biodiversity; lowering of population densities for a wide variety of taxa; disruption of ecosystem functions, including nutrient cycling and succession; change in community organization; and change in the physical characteristics of both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Be- cause livestock congregate in riparian ecosystems, which are among the biologically richest habitats in arid and semiarid regions, the ecological costs of grazing are magnified in these sites. Range science has traditionally been laden with economic assumptions favoring resource use. Conservation biologists are encouraged to contribute to the ongoing social and scientific dialogue on grazing issues.},

abstract = {A simulation study was conducted to explore the effects of drought on financial returns for three different grazing strategies for arid zone beef cattle properties in central Australia. RANGEPACK Herd-Econ, a commercially available herd and property economic model was used to compare the strategies in all possible 10-year sequences of good, average and dry years, to examine the effect of drought period on post drought recovery, and to run the strategies through a historical sequence based on the last 100 years of rainfall data. The management strategies, based on real properties corrected to the same resource base, compared an "average" 3000 AU† property, a "low-stock" 2000 AU property with high and resilient herd biological rates and a "high-stock" 4000 AU property which manages drought conditions by quick destocking tactics.†AU is a large "Animal Unit", 450 kg (liveweight) steer. For the full probability distribution of all possible 10-year sequences, the mean accumulated cash surpluses were {\pounds}1{\textperiodcentered}98m., {\pounds}2{\textperiodcentered}28m. and {\pounds}1{\textperiodcentered}34 m. for the average, high-stock and low-stock management strategies respectively. Both average and high-stock had highly variable financial returns whereas low-stock maintained relatively constant levels. Both average and high-stock recovered quickly from 1-year droughts, but low-stock started to have higher annual returns when droughts lasted 2 years or longer. In the examination of the last 100 years, both average and high-stock would have been bankrupted on today's costs in the 1956-1965 decade, whereas low-stock would have survived with only a small deficit. The mean 10-year accumulated cash surpluses for the 10 historical decades were {\pounds}1{\textperiodcentered}79m., {\pounds}2{\textperiodcentered}1m. and {\pounds}1{\textperiodcentered}28 m. for the average, high-stock and low-stock strategies. This compares well with the results of the full probability distribution. Taxation rates and interest costs can interact to modify the results of this study. Normal rates of taxation and interest applied to the yearly cash surpluses tend to favour the low-stock strategy and its constant moderate cash flows. However, if business management can reduce taxation rates, and attract government support in dry years, then there are income advantages for both the average and the high-stock strategies. All stocking strategies were assumed to be sustainable. In real life, low-stock continues to improve its rangeland resource while high-stock and average are relatively stable, both with some scrub encroachment due to lack of prescribed fire. The average strategy has probably the greatest risk of environmental degradation because of its "wait and see" attitude to drought management. {\textcopyright} 1991 Academic Press Limited.},

The severity of the effect of drought on cattle depends on the stocking rate. Management of herd size is therefore a compromise between harvesting production in average years and the risk of losses in a drought. The authors report on a spreadsheet model that can be used to evaluate herd performance and cashflow using annual rainfall as the only climate input. The model relies on a proxy for pasture availability derived from annual rainfall and stocking rate. This proxy is used for the estimation of reproduction, mortality and liveweight gain. Economic information is calculated to the level of cashflow The model has been used with groups of pastoralists to evaluate the question of drought and stocking rate in terms of economic risk and deterioration of native pastures. It has also been used in consultations with individual pastoralists to help determine which type, and the number, of cattle that should be sacrificed in a drought. ?? 1990.},

abstract = {Knowledge of factors affecting farmer purchases of crop insurance is essential for evaluating the soundness and profitability of crop insurance programs. Despite this importance, the demand for crop insurance has received limited empirical attention. The present paper reports on an empirical assessment of the demand for crop insurance by Iowa corn producers. Adverse selection in the insured pool suggests that producers with differing levels of loss-risk have different demand elasticities. Loss-risk is included in the empirical analysis and is found to influence the elasticity of demand. Results show average demand elasticities of about -0.32 for relative insured acres and -0.73 for liability per planted acre. Implications for the actuarial soundness of the industry are provided.},

abstract = {The application of network analysis to cattle shipments broadens our understanding of shipment patterns beyond pairwise interactions to the network as a whole. Such a quantitative description of cattle shipments in the U.S. can identify trade communities, describe temporal shipment patterns, and inform the design of disease surveillance and control strategies. Here, we analyze a longitudinal dataset of beef and dairy cattle shipments from 2009 to 2011 in the United States to characterize communities within the broader cattle shipment network, which are groups of counties that ship mostly to each other. Because shipments occur over time, we aggregate the data at various temporal scales to examine the consistency of network and community structure over time. Our results identified nine large ({\textgreater}50 counties) communities based on shipments of beef cattle in 2009 aggregated into an annual network and nine large communities based on shipments of dairy cattle. The size and connectance of the shipment network was highly dynamic; monthly networks were smaller than yearly networks and revealed seasonal shipment patterns consistent across years. Comparison of the shipment network over time showed largely consistent shipping patterns, such that communities identified on annual networks of beef and diary shipments from 2009 still represented 41?95{\%} of shipments in monthly networks from 2009 and 41?66{\%} of shipments from networks in 2010 and 2011. The temporal aspects of cattle shipments suggest that future applications of the U.S. cattle shipment network should consider seasonal shipment patterns. However, the consistent within-community shipping patterns indicate that yearly communities could provide a reasonable way to group regions for management.},

abstract = {A 3-yr study evaluated late winter (Feb), early spring (Apr), and late spring (Jun) calving systems in conjunction with varied weaning strategies on beef cow and calf performance from Northern Great Plains rangelands. Crossbred cows were randomly assigned to one of three calving systems (on average n= 168{\textperiodcentered}calving system−1{\textperiodcentered}yr−1) and one of two weaning times (Wean 1, 2) within each calving system. The Feb and Apr calves were weaned at 190 and 240 d of age, whereas Jun calves were weaned at 140 and 190 d of age. Breeding by natural service occurred in a 32-d period that included estrous synchronization. Cows were managed throughout the year as appropriate for their calving season. Quantity and quality of hay and supplements were provided based on forage and weather conditions, physiological state of the cows, and available harvested feed resources within a year. After weaning, two-thirds of the early weaned steers were fed in confinement in Montana, and one-third were shipped to Oklahoma and were grazed or fed forage. One-half of the early weaned heifers grazed seeded pastures, and the other half was fed in confinement. Early weaned calves were weighed on approximately the same day as late-weaned calves. Birth weight and overall rate of gain from birth to weaning did not differ for calves from the three calving systems. Calf weaning weight differed by weaning age within calving system (P = 0.001), and calves from the Jun calving system that were weaned at 190 d of age tended (P = 0.06) to be lighter than calves of the same age from the Feb or Apr calving systems. Cow BW change and BCS dynamics were affected by calving system, but the proportion of cows pregnant in the fall was not. Cows suckled until later dates gained less or lost more BW during the 50 d between the first and second weaning than dry cows during this period. The previous year's weaning assignment did not affect production in the following year. Estimated harvested feed inputs were less for the Jun cows than for the Feb and Apr cows. We conclude that season of calving and weaning age affect outputs from rangeland-based beef cattle operations.},

abstract = {Forecasting significant weather events, such as floods, heat waves, arctic outbreaks, ice storms, large severe weather outbreaks, and major winter storms, is a critical function for all weather services. However, conventional pressure level geopotential and temperature fields often are insufficient to determine whether an event represents a large departure from normal. This is largely due to the variability that exists throughout the year and regionally throughout the world. What represents an unusual departure from average conditions in fall may not be as unusual in winter. What is an unusual departure from average conditions in California may be normal in New England. This paper presents a method, normalized field departures from local climatology, that gives forecasters guidance on the relative rarity of events. Thus, in this paper a method is presented to help forecasters identify potentially significant weather events. The focus of this paper is on significant winter storms. However, a record winter warmth event is shown to demonstrate the broad potential use of this method. The results suggest that many record snowstorms in the literature were associated with storms that departed significantly from normal. Using model data, it is demonstrated that models can successfully forecast events that represent a significant departure from normal. In fact, the results suggest that the models are quite successful at forecasting unusually strong weather systems in the short range (2–3 days) and show some success out to 6 days.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mortality during sustained periods of hot weather is generally regarded as being in excess of what would be predicted from smooth temperature-mortality gradients estimated using standard time-series regression models. However, the evidence for an effect of continuous days of exceptional heat ("heat wave effect") is indirect. In addition, because some interventions may be triggered only during forecasted heat waves, it would be helpful to know what fraction of all heat-related deaths falls during these specific periods and what fraction occurs throughout the remainder of the summer. METHODS: Extended time-series data sets of daily mortality counts in 3 major European cities (London, 28 years of data; Budapest, 31 years; Milan, 18 years) were examined in relation to hot weather using a generalized estimating equations approach. We modeled temperature and specific heat wave terms using a variety of specifications. RESULTS: With a linear effect of same-day temperature above an identified threshold, an additional "heat wave" effect of 5.5{\%} was observed in London (95{\%} confidence interval = 2.2 to 8.9), 9.3{\%} in Budapest (5.8 to 13.0), and 15.2{\%} in Milan (5.7 to 22.5). Heat wave effects were reduced slightly when we relaxed the linear assumption and these effects were reduced substantially when temperature was modeled as an average value of lags 0 to 2 days. In London, fewer than half of all heat-related deaths could be attributed to identified heat wave periods. In Milan and Budapest, the fraction was less than one fifth. CONCLUSIONS: Heat wave effects were apparent in simple time-series models but were reduced in multilag nonlinear models and small when compared with the overall summertime mortality burden of heat. Reduction of the overall heat burden requires preventive measures in addition to those that target warnings and responses uniquely to heat waves.},

A variety of indices, such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI), are used for drought monitoring based on different indicator variables. Because of the complexity of drought phenomena in their causation and impact, drought monitoring based on a single variable may be insufficient for detecting drought conditions in a prompt and reliable manner. This study outlines a multivariate, multi-index drought moni-toring framework, namely, the multivariate standardized drought index (MSDI), for describing droughts based on the states of precipitation and soil moisture. In this study, the MSDI is evaluated against U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) data as well as the commonly used standardized indices for drought monitoring, including detecting drought onset, persistence, and spatial extent across the continental United States. The results indicate that MSDI includes attractive properties, such as higher probability of drought detection, compared to individual precipitation and soil moisture–based drought indices. This study shows that the MSDI leads to drought information generally consistent with the USDM and provides additional information and insights into drought monitoring.},

abstract = {Stocking rate and grazing management deci-sions during drought may be the most impor-tant decisions made. The effects of these decisions go far beyond survival during the drought and greatly influence recovery follow-ing drought. No two ranches are completely identical and as such, need to make stocking rate and grazing management decisions before, during, and after a drought that are compati-ble with the goals of the operation. This paper is intended to highlight options for stocking rate and grazing management deci-sions related to drought. Supply and Demand Ranch forage supplies must be constantly evaluated to match supply with demand. Forage supply must meet or exceed forage demand or the forage base may eventually contribute to the demise of the operation. Reduction in stocking rates during severe drought pays big dividends in terms of less damage to desirable forage plants, rapid recovery of the range following drought, re-duced supplemental feeding costs, and re-duced losses to toxic plants, just to name a few. Determining the supply of forage available for livestock consumption could be one of the toughest tasks for ranchers. However, for plants to survive drought conditions, the amount of forage left ungrazed becomes as important as the amount produced. Future forage production depends on healthy plants that can survive drought and recover quickly when favorable conditions exist. Rainfall is less effective when plant and litter cover on the soil surface is reduced. Leaving stock in a pasture too long when forage supply is inade-quate may permanently reduce carrying capac-ity for both livestock and wildlife.},

abstract = {Changes in temperature, CO2, and precipitation under the scenarios of climate change for the next 30 yr present a challenge to crop production. Th is review focuses on the impact of temperature, CO2, and ozone on agronomic crops and the implications for crop production. Understanding these implications for agricultural crops is critical for developing cropping systems resilient to stresses induced by climate change. Th ere is variation among crops in their response to CO2, temperature, and precipitation changes and, with the regional diff erences in predicted climate, a situation is created in which the responses will be further compli- cated. For example, the temperature eff ects on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] could potentially cause yield reductions of 2.4{\%} in the South but an increase of 1.7{\%} in the Midwest. Th e frequency of years when temperatures exceed thresholds for damage during critical growth stages is likely to increase for some crops and regions. Th e increase in CO2 contributes signifi cantly to enhanced plant growth and improved water use effi ciency (WUE); however, there may be a downscaling of these positive impacts due to higher temperatures plants will experience during their growth cycle. A challenge is to understand the interactions of the chang- ing climatic parameters because of the interactions among temperature, CO2, and precipitation on plant growth and development and also on the biotic stresses of weeds, insects, and diseases. Agronomists will have to consider the variations in temperature and precipitation as part of the production system if they are to ensure the food security required by an ever increasing population.},

abstract = {The over 300??million ha of public and private rangelands in the United States are characterized by low and variable precipitation, nutrient-poor soils, and high spatial and temporal variability in plant production. This land type has provided a variety of goods and services, with the provisioning of food and fiber dominating through much of the 20th century. More recently, food production from a rangeland-based livestock industry is often pressured for a variety of reasons, including poor economic returns, increased regulations, an aging rural population, and increasingly diverse interests of land owners. A shift to other provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services is occurring with important implications for carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and conservation incentives. There are numerous goods and services possible from rangelands that can supply societal demands such as clean water and a safe food supply. The use of ecologically-based principles of land management remains at the core of the ability of private land owners and public land managers to provide these existing and emerging services. We suggest that expectations need to be based on a thorough understanding of the diverse potentials of these lands and their inherent limits. A critical provisioning service to rangelands will be management practices that either maintain ecological functions or that restore functions to systems that have been substantially degraded over past decades. With proper incentives and economic benefits, rangelands, in the U.S. or globally, can be expected to provide these historical and more unique goods and services in a sustainable fashion, albeit in different proportions than in the past.},

This research was the second of a series of studies investigating the impacts of varying seasonal droughts on northern Great Plains rangelands. Research was conducted on native rangeland during the 1998 through 2001 growing seasons. Study plots were twelve 5 × 10 m nonweighing lysimeters. An automated rainout shelter was used to establish drought conditions on 6 lysimeters during April, May, and June of 1998 and 1999. Single-day, flash grazing events were imposed at the beginning of May, June, and July. Grazing treatments were 1) graze during the 2 years of drought and the year after; 2) graze during the 2 years of drought and rest the year after; and 3) rest all years. Results showed that the intense spring drought reduced soil water content in the upper 30 cm of the soil profile and subsequently reduced total herbage production 20{\%} to 40{\%}; cool-season perennial grasses were the primary contributor to the reduction and cool-season annual grasses were secondary. Periodic grazing during drought had minimal impact on herbage production, whereas impacts on nondrought plots ranged from moderate enhancement to moderate suppression, with effects varying depending on functional group. Results also showed that substantial recovery occurred during the 1st postdrought year, with near full recovery realized within 2 years.},

abstract = {AbstractMany operational drought indices focus primarily on precipitation and temperature when depicting hydroclimatic anomalies, and this perspective can be augmented by analyses and products that reflect the evaporative dynamics of drought. We leverage the linkage between atmospheric evaporative demand (E0) and actual evapotranspiration (ET) in a new drought index based solely on E0—the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI). EDDI measures the signal of drought through the response of E0 to surface drying anomalies that result from two distinct land surface-atmosphere interactions: (1) a complementary relationship between E0 and ET that develops as moisture becomes limited at the land surface, leading to ET declining and increasing E0, as in sustained droughts; and (2) parallel ET and E0 increases arising from increased energy availability leading to surface moisture limitation, as in flash droughts. To calculate EDDI from E0, we use a long-term, daily reanalysis of reference ET estimated by the Americ...},

@article{Hoerling2014,
abstract = {Central Great Plains precipitation deficits during May-August 2012 were the most severe since at least 1895, eclipsing the Dust Bowl summers of 1934 and 1936. Drought developed suddenly in May, following near-normal precipitation during winter and early spring. Its proximate causes were a reduction in atmospheric moisture transport into the Great Plains from the Gulf of Mexico. Processes that generally provide air mass lift and condensation were mostly absent, including a lack of frontal cyclones in late spring followed by suppressed deep convection in summer owing to large-scale subsidence and atmospheric stabilization. Seasonal forecasts did not predict the summer 2012 central Great Plains drought development, which therefore arrived without early warning. Climate simulations and empirical analysis suggest that ocean surface temperatures together with changes in greenhouse gases did not induce a substantial reduction in summertime precipitation over the central Great Plains during 2012. Yet, diagnosis of the retrospective climate simulations also reveals a regime shift toward warmer and drier summertime Great Plains conditions during the recent decade, most probably due to natural decadal variability. As a consequence, the probability for severe summer Great Plains drought may have increased in the last decade compared to the 1980s and 1990s, and the so-called tail-risk for severe drought may have been heightened in summer 2012. Such an extreme drought event was nonetheless still found to be a rare occurrence within the spread of 2012 climate model simulations.},

abstract = {Daily weight gains and diets of cattle were evaluated during a year with average precipitation and in a drought year on mountain range in northeastern Oregon. Forage intake was evaluated only in the drought year. Esophageally fistulated heifers were used to sample diet quality and botanical composition. Botanical composition of cattle diets was different (P{\textless}.05) in the late spring and early summer between years. When green grass and forbs were not available, browse was heavily utilized. Livestock weight gains and forage intake in the latter part of the grazing season were reduced (P{\textless}.05) during the drought year. This is attributed to depletion of browse, primarily common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus). Diet crude protein and neutral detergent fiber concentrations were significantly (P{\textless}.05) correlated with average daily gains. When ruminants are consuming diets with more than one forage class, neutral detergent fiber and composition and yield of volatile fatty acids may more accurately evaluate the energy status of the diet than digestibility. Supplementation of crude protein could potentially improve average daily gains during drought years if browse was unavailable. Ranges with a high component of forbs and shrubs will ameliorate the negative effects of drought on average daily gains.},

Second, if the object is damaged, people are also more willing to go through the trouble of claiming a fixed amount of compensation, the more affection they have for the object. These effects are not predicted by standard decision theories. We explain these findings by a ‘‘consolation hypothesis,'' according to which, people perceive insurance compensation as a token of consolation, and we discuss its implications for affective influences in other types of decisions.},

However, biomes differ substantially in sensitivity of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) to between-year variation in precipitation. Average rain-use efficiency (RUE; ANPP/precipitation) also varies between biomes, supposedly because of differences in vegetation structure and/or biogeochemical constraints. Here we show that RUE decreases across biomes as mean annual precipitation increases. However, during the driest years at each site, there is convergence to a common maximum RUE (RUE(max)) that is typical of arid ecosystems. RUE(max) was also identified by experimentally altering the degree of limitation by water and other resources. Thus, in years when water is most limiting, deserts, grasslands and forests all exhibit the same rate of biomass production per unit rainfall, despite differences in physiognomy and site-level RUE. Global climate models predict increased between-year variability in precipitation, more frequent extreme drought events, and changes in temperature. Forecasts of future ecosystem behaviour should take into account this convergent feature of terrestrial biomes.},

abstract = {This study examines the impact of publicly supported insurance on agricultural land values. The analysis employs connidential, nationally representative panel data on pastureland values and exploits a natural experiment provided by gradual introduction of the Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage Insurance Pilot Program. We use a model that controls for several time-variant factors. We ind that insurance availability is associated with an increase of at least 4 percent in pastureland values. This increase is comparable with increases generated by other government programs but is much smaller than total farmland value increases experienced in recent years. Publicly supported insurance programs are an increasingly important component of U.S. agricultural policy. Acres insured under federal crop insurance, for example, increased from 197 million in 1999 to 265 million in 2011, and total premium subsidies increased from {\$}950 million to {\$}7.4 billion over the same period (Risk Management Agency 2012b). The number of publicly supported insurance programs has also increased in recent years, most notably with introduction of the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) Program in 2008. New farm programs included in the Agricultural Act of 2014 suggest that insurance programs are expected to play a larger role in the agricultural sector in the future. Previous studies have examined factors that innluence farmers' decisions to purchase crop insurance (Sherrick et al. 2004), the decision to exit crop insurance (Cabas, Levia, and Weersink 2008), and the price elasticity of crop insurance (Coble et al. 1996). Others have considered issues related to adverse selection and moral hazard (Just, Calvin, and Quiggin 1999). It is also known that the availability of crop insurance can impact land-use and production decisions. O'Donoghue, Roberts, and Key (2009) found that insurance subsidies implemented as part of the 1994 Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act resulted in a moderate increase in specialization and production efficiency but the value of the efficiency gains was far smaller than the value of the subsidies.

abstract = {This study explores various aspects of catchment hydrology based on a mechanistic modeling of distributed watershed processes. A new physics-based, distributed-parameter hydrological model that uses an irregular spatial discretization is introduced. The model accounts, on a continuous basis, for the processes of rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, moisture dynamics in the unsaturated and saturated zones, and runoff routing. Simulations of several mid- to large-sized watersheds ( 10 3 km2) highlight various dynamic relationships between the vadose zone -- groundwater processes and their dependence on the land surface characteristics. It is argued that the model inferences can be used for interpretation of distributed relationships in a catchment. By exploiting a multiple-resolution representation, the hydrologic features of the watershed terrain are captured with only 5 -- 10{\%} of the original grid nodes. This computational efficiency suggests the feasibility of the operational use of fully distributed, physics-based models for large watersheds.},

abstract = {Early weaning of beef calves reduces nutrient and forage demand in a cow–calf enterprise, potentially contributing to reduction in forage utilization on the pasture from which calves are removed by a nonlactating cow vs. a cow–calf pair. Research was conducted to evaluate weaning beef calves 90 days early (EW) vs. normal weaning (NW) on pasture herbage disappearance in mixed-grass prairie pastures in the northern Great Plains. Spring-calving cows (n = 48) were utilized in each study year (2003, 2004, and 2006) from the date of early weaning (August) until the date of normal weaning (November). Cow–calf pairs were randomly assigned each year to each NW pasture (n = 8 pasture–1); cows whose calves had been weaned early were randomly assigned to each EW pasture (n = 8 pasture–1). No calves grazed EW pastures. Cattle were weighed and body condition scored at the beginning and end of each trial period. Available herbage was determined before and after grazing in each pasture. The effect of weaning treatment on cow average daily gain and body condition score change was highly significant (P {\textless} 0.001). Early-weaned cows gained weight and condition; normal-weaned cows lost weight and condition. Herbage disappearance was lower (P = 0.017) in EW than NW pastures, resulting in 18.9 lb cow–1 day–1, or 36{\%}, herbage savings. This is equivalent to an additional 1.1 month of grazing saved per animal unit over a 90-day period. The value of the additional animal-unit months includes extending the grazing season, increasing cow numbers, or as "banked" forage for drought management.},

abstract = {Extreme droughts like the recent 2011–2013 drought impacting the central and western United States present a challenge to sustaining livestock ranching operations and the ecosystem goods and services they produce. Wyoming ranchers manage half of this drought-prone state and are at the forefront of this challenge. We examined Wyoming ranchers' drought management strategies and how ranch characteristics affect drought management flexibility, a key component of resilience, through a mail survey. We find that many survey respondents manage drought in similar ways, by selling livestock and buying feed, highlighting the market risks associated with drought. Ranches that are larger, include yearling livestock, use shorter grazing periods, and/or incorporate alternative on-ranch activities (e.g., hunting) use more drought management practices and thus have greater flexibility. Larger ranches experience fewer drought impacts, highlighting advantages of a larger resource base. Our findings suggest three components of national drought policy that encourages flexibility and thus increases resilience of ranches to drought: (1) encouraging forage-sharing mechanisms; (2) promoting income diversification that is independent of climatic variability; and (3) facilitating a shift to diversified livestock production systems. These measures could increase sustainability of ranching livelihoods and provision of ecosystem services despite predicted increases in intensity and duration of future droughts.},

abstract = {Spanning 12 million hectares, Wyoming rangelands produce food and provide other vital ecosystem services. How-ever, the decision-making process of the ranchers who steward these lands is complex and poorly understood. In co-operation with the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA)—a predominant agricultural organization in the state—we asked WSGA producer members about their goals, ranching operation characteristics, and management prac-tices via a mail survey. A total of 307 ranchers (50{\%}) responded to the survey. Livestock production and forage production were the top management goals, with ecosystem characteristics that support these goals (e.g., soil health, water quality) tied for second. Survey respondents' ranches had a median size of 4,220 hectares, but ranged up to 185,000 hectares; 71{\%} of operations included public land and 60{\%} included private leased land. The majority of re-porting operations grazed cow-calf pairs (91{\%}), with a median of 260 pairs per ranch. Most survey respondents man-aged grazing by moving 1-5 herds of livestock (84{\%}) among two or more pastures (92{\%}) after three months of grazing or less (87{\%}). Most operations (74{\%}) included other resource use activities, with extractive recreation (e.g., hunting; 55{\%}), conventional energy development (23{\%}), and other agricultural production (20{\%}) most common. Survey re-spondents primarily got information about grazing management from other ranchers (97{\%}), although they preferred to receive information through print publications (69{\%}). Wyoming ranching operations are diverse, which may represent a challenge for policy makers designing programs and incentives to increase production of food and ecosystem services. However, efforts that focus on livestock and forage production and supporting ecosystem functions are likely to find synergies with ongoing management goals and strategies. A multi-pronged outreach and education approach using several different media sources may be most effective as new policies and management practices become available.},

Binding credit market constraints and incomplete insurance can limit investment in activities with high expected profits. We conducted several experiments in northern Ghana in which farmers were randomly assigned to receive cash grants, grants of or opportunities to purchase rainfall index insurance, or a combination of the two. Demand for index insurance is strong, and insurance leads to significantly larger agricultural investment and riskier production choices in agriculture. The binding constraint to farmer investment is uninsured risk: when provided with insurance against the primary catastrophic risk they face, farmers are able to find resources to increase expenditure on their farms. Demand for insurance in subsequent years is strongly increasing with the farmer's own receipt of insurance payouts, with the receipt of payouts by others in the farmer's social network and with recent poor rain in the village. Both investment patterns and the demand for index insurance are consistent with the presence of important basis risk associated with the index insurance, imperfect trust that promised payouts will be delivered and overweighting recent events.},

Index-based risk manage-ment instruments could help crop farmers to reduce their farm income risk. Such instruments have some important advantages over damage-based insurance, like e.g. less moral hazard and adverse selection. At the same time they typically have a high level of basis risk. Up to now, mainly precipitation-based weather derivatives have been discussed as an appropriate risk management instrument for farmers in Germany. As a potentially more effective alternative, we propose water capacity-based index insurance. In order to show the benefits of a precipitation-based and water capacity-based index insurance, several contract designs are compared. Using a whole farm risk program planning approach, we show that for an average agricultural producer in Eastern Germany water capacity-based index insurance offers greater benefits than precipitation-based index insurance.},

Remote sensing studies report widespread degradation, but there are no long-term field studies of vegetation responses to shifts in climate and stocking densities.In 2013, we resampled plots originally sampled in 1994-1995 in the desert-steppe, steppe and mountain-steppe, and analyzed changes in vegetation in relation to changes in climate, stocking densities and forage use. Summer temperatures significantly increased and stocking densities fluctuated in response to droughts followed by harsh winters. Total herbaceous biomass in 2013 was similar to (desert-steppe and steppe) or greater than (mountain-steppe) in 1995, and total foliar and herbaceous cover were unchanged since 1995 in all zones. In the mountain-steppe, functional type and species cover shifts were consistent with warming temperatures and increasing grazing pressure. All species richness and diversity indicators declined significantly in the mountain-steppe since 1995, as did richness in the steppe. Some Mongolian rangelands may be losing resilience due to interacting climate and grazing pressures, but our data suggest degradation observed at our study sites is reversible. Mountain-steppe systems appear more vulnerable to grazing- and climate-induced vegetation change than steppe and desert-steppe.},

abstract = {State-and-transition models (STMs) are being developed for many areas in the United States and represent an important tool for assessing and managing public and private rangelands. Substantial resources have been invested in model development, yet minimal efforts have been made to evaluate the utility of STMs for rangeland assessment and management. We interviewed 47 rangeland professionals, equally divided between managers and researchers, in four ecoregions to determine their perceptions of the purpose, development, and strengths and weaknesses of STMs to assess the status of the STM framework. Our analysis identified three primary perspectives regarding the purpose of STMs: a decision-making tool for land managers, a means to represent the complex dynamics of rangeland ecosystems, and an effective communication tool. These diverse views of STM purposes were associated with differing perspectives concerning model development that identified five major issues in need of further development and refinement: 1) the relative importance of management practices and ecological processes in driving transitions, 2) the criteria used to define thresholds, 3) the appropriate level of model complexity, 4) the respective roles of expert knowledge and ecological data in model development, and 5) processes for model review and revision. We recommend greater dialogue among researchers and managers to further clarify STM terminology and develop standard protocols for model development and validation. Mechanisms are critically needed to assure peer review and revision of existing models so that STMs are continually updated to reflect current understanding of rangeland dynamics.},

Temperature impacts everything from the amount of energy we consume to heat and cool our homes and offices to our ability to work outside. Precipitation levels not only determine how much water we have to drink, but also the performance of entire economic sectors, from agriculture to recreation and tourism. Extreme weather events, like hurricanes, droughts, and inland flooding can be particularly damaging, costing Americans more than {\$}110 billion in 2012 (NOAA 2013a). Economic and technological development has made us less vulnerable to the elements. Lighting allows us to work and play after the sun goes down. Buildings protect us from wind and water. Heating and air conditioning allow us to enjoy temperate conditions at all times of the day and year. That economic growth, however, has begun to change the climate. Scientists are increasingly certain that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion and deforestation, along with other greenhouse gases (GHGs), are raising average temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increasing global sea levels.

The federal government then comes to the rescue with disaster assistance even if it claimed it had no intention of doing so prior to the event. There are a number of reasons why individuals do not protect themselves prior to a disaster. They underesti- mate the likelihood of a future disaster, often believing that it will not happen to them; have budget constraints; are myopic in their behavior; and/or do not want to be the only one on the block modifying their structure. Given this lack of interest in voluntary protection, benefit-cost analysis can determine when a well-enforced building code would be appropriate. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of public-private partnerships as a way of reducing future disaster losses from and aiding the recovery process.},

We explore various strategies that take into account the simplified decision- making processes used by individuals and resulting biases. We make these points by working through two examples: (1) investments in energy efficiency products and new technology and (2) adaptation measures to reduce property damage from future floods and hurricanes. In both cases there is a reluctance to undertake these measures due to high and certain upfront costs, delayed and probabilistic benefits, and behavioural biases related to this asymmetry. The use of choice architecture through framing and the use of default options coupled with short-term incentives and long-term contracts can encourage greater investment in these measures.},

abstract = {The reduction of soil moisture content during droughts lowers the plant water potential and decreases transpiration; this in turn causes a reduction of cell turgor and relative water content which brings about a sequence of damages of increasing seriousness. A review of the literature on plant physiology and water stress shows that vegetation water stress can be assumed to start at the soil moisture level corresponding to incipient stomatal closure and reach a maximum intensity at the wilting point. The mean crossing properties of these soil moisture levels crucial for water stress are derived analytically for the stochastic model of soil moisture dynamics described in Part II (F. Laio, A. Porporato, L. Ridolfi, I. Rodriguez-Iturbe. Adv. Water Res. 24 (7) (2001) 707–723). These properties are then used to propose a measure of vegetation water stress which combines the mean intensity, duration, and frequency of periods of soil water deficit. The characteristics of vegetation water stress are then studied under different climatic conditions, showing how the interplay between plant, soil, and environment can lead to optimal conditions for vegetation.},

Water Res. 24 (7) (2001) 725-744) of this series of papers. In the savanna of Nylsvley (South Africa) the very diverse physiological characteristics of the existing plants give rise to different strategies of soil moisture exploitation. Notwithstanding these differences, the vegetation water stress for all the species turns out to be very similar, suggesting that coexistence might be attained also through differentiation of water use. The case of the savanna of Southern Texas points out how rooting depth and interannual rainfall variability can impact soil moisture dynamics and vegetation water stress. Because of the different responses to water stress of trees and grasses, external climatic forcing could be at the origin of the dynamic equilibrium allowing coexistence in this ecosystem. Finally, the analysis of a short grass steppe in Colorado provides an interesting example of the so-called inverse texture effect, whereby preferential conditions for vegetation are dependent on soil texture and rainfall. Sites which are more favorable during wet conditions may become less suitable to the same vegetation type during drier years. Such an effect is important to explain the predominance of existing species, as well as to investigate their reproductive strategies. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Farm, ranch, and feedlot operators make decisions on cattle trades according to cattle weights and market conditions. Contact networks of cattle are generated by geographical proximity and disease is spread through a simple compartmental model on the dynamic contact structures. An analysis of the network metrics of the contact networks and the aggregated contact networks provides insight into the influence of the network dynamics on the epidemic dynamics. Using farm data based on the Kansas cattle industry, our experiments show a tri-modal distribution of total case counts that becomes bi-modal for weaker diseases. These results are explained by the interaction of the disease and trading processes. We show how simple network metrics, such as the average node degree, can track the complex trading processes which shape the evolution of the disease at an agent level. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

They assume that people assess the desirability and likelihood of possible outcomes of choice alternatives and integrate this information through some type of expectation-based calculus to arrive at a decision. The authors propose an alternative theoretical perspective, the risk-as-feelings hypothesis, that highlights the role of affect experienced at the moment of decision making. Drawing on research from clinical, physiological, and other subfields of psychology, they show that emotional reactions to risky situations often diverge from cognitive assessments of those risks. When such divergence occurs, emotional reactions often drive behavior. The risk-as-feelings hypothesis is shown to explain a wide range of phenomena that have resisted interpretation in cognitive-consequentialist terms.},

@article{Ludwig2005,
abstract = {Ecological and hydrological processes can interact strongly in landscapes, yet these processes are often studied separately. One particularly important interaction between these processes in patchy semiarid lands is how vegetation patches serve to obstruct runoff and then how this retained water increases patch growth that, in turn, provides feedbacks to the system. Such ecohydrological interactions have been mostly demonstrated for semiarid landscapes with distinctly banded vegetation patterns. In this paper, we use data from our studies and from the literature to evaluate how strongly four ecohydrological interactions apply across other patchy semiarid vegetations, and how these interactions are affected by disturbances. We specifically address four questions concerning ecohydrological interactions: (1) if vegetation patches obstruct runoff flows during rainfall events, how much more soil water is stored in these patches compared to open interpatch areas; (2) if inputs of water are higher in patches, how much stronger is the pulse of plant growth compared to interpatches; (3) if more soil water in patches promotes greater biological activity by organisms such as earthworms that create macropores, how much does this improve soil infiltrability; and (4) if vegetation patches are damaged on a hillslope, how much does this increase runoff and erosion and decrease biomass production? We used the trigger-transfer-reserve-pulse framework developed for Australian semiarid woodlands to put these four questions into a landscape context. For a variety of patchy semiarid vegetation types in Australia, Europe, and North America, we found that patches significantly stored more soil water, produced more growth and had better infiltrability than interpatches, and that runoff and erosion can markedly increase on disturbed hillslopes. However, these differences varied greatly and appeared to depend on factors such as the intensity and amount of input events (rainstorms) and type of topography, soils, and vegetation. Experimental and modeling studies are needed to better quantify how these factors specifically affect ecohydrological interactions. Our current findings do support the conclusion that vegetation patches and runoff-erosion processes do strongly interact in many semiarid landscapes across the globe, not just banded landscapes.},

However, very little is known about whether or how corporate social responsibility affects employees. Because employees are primary stakeholders who directly contribute to the success of the company, understanding employee reactions to corporate social responsibility may help answer lingering questions about the potential effects of corporate social responsibility on firms as well as illuminate some of the processes responsible for them. To begin our chapter, we provide a brief history of scholarship on corporate social responsibility and highlight some of the major challenges researchers in this area currently face. We then discuss why corporate social responsibility may represent a special opportunity to influence employees' general impression of their company. Next, we identify four distinct paths through which corporate social responsibility may affect employees' relationship with their company that correspond to four universal psychological needs: security, self-esteem, belongingness, and a meaningful existence.

Steers were weighed biweekly; forage production, utilization, and botanical composition were estimated by clipping; and basai cover was estimated by inclined point frame. Basal cover of litter and bare ground responded to stocking rate or grazing systems, but basal cover of vegetation was affected only by years. Steer average daily gain decreased as grazing pressure increased (r' = 0.66); systems had no significant effect. The most profitable stocking rate at 1986-87 costs and prices was approximately 60 to 80{\%} above SCS recommendations, but the increase in return was small and range conditions and forage production probably could not be maintained a1},

abstract = {In recent years, federal land management agencies in the United States have been tasked to consider climate change vulnerability and adaptation in their planning. Ecological vulnerability approaches have been the dominant framework, but these approaches have significant limitations for fully understanding vulnerability in complex social-ecological systems in and around multiple-use public lands. In this paper, we describe the context of United States federal public lands management with an emphasis on the Bureau of Land Management to highlight this unique decision-making context. We then assess the strengths and weaknesses of an ecological vulnerability approach for informing decision-making. Next, we review social vulnerability methods in the context of public lands to demonstrate what these approaches can contribute to our understanding of vulnerability, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we suggest some key design principles for integrated social-ecological vulnerability assessments considering the context of public lands management, the limits of ecological vulnerability assessment, and existing approaches to social vulnerability assessment. We argue for the necessity of including social vulnerability in a more integrated social-ecological approach in order to better inform climate change adaptation.},

Although climate adaptation has been strengthened in the Paris Agreement, climate-related risks may exceed adaptation possibilities of communities and countries. To this effect, an important decision in the Paris Agreement was the endorsement of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) for Loss and Damage (L{\&}D) (3). This established L{\&}D as a distinct pillar of climate negotiations, yet with an unclearly defined remit. With a policy framework yet to emerge, the 22nd Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in November in Marrakesh will review the structure, mandate, and effectiveness of the WIM, first institutionalized in 2013. Risk science can provide a rationale and delineate a policy space for L{\&}D, composed of curative measures for unavoided and unavoidable impacts, and transformative measures for avoiding and managing increasingly intolerable risks.},

abstract = {Debate regarding the relationship between socioeconomic development and natural disasters remains at the fore of global discussions, as the potential risk from climate extremes and uncertainty pose an increasing threat to developmental prospects. This study reviews statistical investigations of disaster and development linkages, across topics of macroeconomic growth, public governance and others to identify key challenges to the current approach to macro-level statistical investigation. Both theoretically and qualitatively, disaster is known to affect development through a number of channels: haphazard development, weak institutions, lack of social safety nets and short-termism of our decision-making practices are some of the factors that drive natural disaster risk. Developmental potentials, including the prospects for sustainable and equitable growth, are in turn threatened by such accumulation of disaster risks. However, quantitative evidence regarding these complex causality chains remains contested due to several reasons. A number of theoretical and methodological limitations have been identified, including the use of GDP as a proxy measurement of welfare, issues with natural disaster damage reporting and the adoption of ad hoc model specifications and variables, which render interpretation and cross-comparison of statistical analysis difficult. Additionally, while greater attention is paid to economic and institutional parameters such as GDP, remittance, corruption and public expenditure as opposed to hard-to-quantify yet critical factors such as environmental conditions and social vulnerabilities. These are gaps in our approach that hamper our comprehensive understanding of the disaster-development nexus. Important areas for further research are identified, including recognizing and addressing the data constraints, incorporating sustainability and equity concerns through alternatives to GDP, and finding novel approaches to examining the complex and dynamic relationships between risk, vulnerability, resilience, adaptive capacity and development. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of these two events on cattle mortality in France, one of the most severely impacted countries.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Poisson regressions were used to model the national baseline for cattle mortality between 2004 and 2005 and predict the weekly number of expected deaths in 2003 and 2006 for the whole cattle population and by subpopulation based on age and type of production. Observed and estimated values were compared to identify and quantify excess mortality. The same approach was used at a departmental scale (a French department being an administrative and territorial division) to assess the spatio-temporal evolution of the mortality pattern.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall, the models estimated relative excess mortality of 24{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval: 22-25{\%}] for the two-week heat wave of 2003, and 12{\%} [11-14{\%}] for the three-week heat wave of 2006. In 2003, most cattle subpopulations were impacted during the heat wave and some in the following weeks too. In 2006, cattle subpopulations were impacted for a limited time only, with no excess mortality at the beginning or after the heat wave. No marked differences in cattle mortality were found among the different subpopulations by age and type of production. The implications of these results for risk prevention are discussed.},

We analyzed the proposed Broader Impacts (ie the activities that benefit society through teaching, broadening participation, enhancing infrastructure, and disseminating research) of proposals funded by NSF's Ecosystem Studies Program. We obtained abstracts from 296 funded proposals from NSF's website and characterized the scope of the proposed Broader Impacts (2000–2009). Only 65{\%} of abstracts included a Broader Impacts statement and, of those, 57 (19{\%}) included just one of five NSF broader impacts activities (BIAs).

abstract = {In this article, possible use of climate forecasts in rainfall index insurance of hay and forage production is considered in a geographical area (southeast United States) relatively heavily impacted by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Analysis of the stochastic properties of rainfall, yields, and the ENSO forecasts using the copula technique shows that the forecast impact depends on the proximity to the Gulf Coast where the impact of the ENSO is more pronounced and earlier in the year. Stochastic modeling shows that the use of skillful long-term climate forecasts by the insured producers creates intertemporal adverse selection that can be precluded by offering forecast conditional premiums. The impacts on the efficiency of the rainfall index insurance and results of sensitivity analysis with respect to model pa-rameters are discussed. Over the past two decades, several alternative designs of agricultural crop insurance have been tried in an attempt to increase participa-tion rates and improve actuarial performance of the program. However, reducing moral hazard and adverse selection inherent in insurance contracts is frequently associated with reduc-tion in the risk covered by insurance (Glauber, 2004). One example is the index-based agri-cultural insurance that largely avoids the moral hazard issues and can be especially applicable for crops and areas with limited yield/revenue records and where agriculture is more rainfall-dependent (Skees, 2008). In 2007, the U.S. Risk Management Agency (RMA) introduced a pilot program to offer Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage (PRF) insur-ance that provides protection against losses of forage produced for grazing or harvested for hay (RMA, 2012). Two types of PRF insurance contracts are currently available under the pilot program, both of which are designed to in-demnify producers when yield-reducing drought conditions arise. Rainfall Index (RI) contracts indemnify policyholders based on gridded 0.25° latitude by 0.25° longitude rainfall data published by the National Oceanic and Atmo-spheric Administration Climate Prediction Cen-ter.

abstract = {The media are powerful agents that translate information across the science–policy interface, framing it for audiences. Yet frames are never neutral: they define an issue, identify causes, make moral judgements and shape proposed solutions. Here, we show how the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) was framed in UK and US broadcast and print coverage, and on Twitter. Coverage of IPCC Working Group I (WGI) was contested and politicized, employing the ‘Settled Science, Uncertain Science, Political or Ideological Struggle and Role of Science' frames. WGII coverage commonly used Disaster or Security. More diverse frames were employed for WGII and WGIII, including Economics and Morality and Ethics. Framing also varied by media institution: for example, the BBC used Uncertain Science, whereas Channel 4 did not. Coverage varied by working group, with WGIII gaining far less coverage than WGI or WGII. We suggest that media coverage and framing of AR5 was influenced by its sequential three-part structure and by the availability of accessible narratives and visuals. We recommend that these communication lessons be applied to future climate science reports.},

abstract = {population fluctuations in northern Kenya. The way the grazing lands and animal populations are affected by drought requires long-term monitoring. However, in northern Kenya, patterns of cattle mortality following multiple drought episodes and recovery have not been compared before. This study compared effects of two droughts (1983/1984 and 1991/1992) and three recovery periods (1984, 1992 and 1996) on cattle population in Obbu, northern Kenya. Cattle mortality in terms of age-sex classes; calves, immature animals, breeding females and mature males were compared to understand drought impacts, while relative growth rates of herds and percentage of recovery to pre-drought cattle population levels were determined to understand recovery. The droughts altered herd structure and resulted in greater mortality among calves and breeding females (especially during 1983/1984) than immature animals and mature male cattle. Drought stress in terms of cattle mortality varied from area to another but at the regional level it was less during the 1983/1984 drought (69)8{\$}2)0{\%}) than 1991/1992 (86)8{\$}1)9{\%}). The pre-1983/1984 drought herd size for the Obbu region explained 12)4{\%} of the variation of the post-drought cattle population, while the pre-1991/1992 drought population explained(1{\%} of the variation. Although cattle mortality was weakly linked to the pre-drought population, it was influenced by factors such as disease epidemics and poor nutritional quality in forage. Relative growth rates of herds in Obbu averaged 3)5{\%} year!1 after the 1983/1984 drought leading to full recovery in 7 years, while, after the 1991/1992 drought, mean relative growth rate was 2)8{\%} year!1, which after 5 years only achieved ca.32{\%} recovery of the pre-1991/1992 drought cattle population},

abstract = {Mean annual precipitation accounts for a large proportion of the variation in mean above-ground net primary production (ANPP) of grasslands worldwide. However, the inter-annual variation in production in any grassland site is only loosely correlated with precipitation. The longest record of variation in production and precipitation for a site corresponds to a shortgrass steppe in Colorado, USA. A previous study of this record showed that current-year precipitation accounted for 39{\%} of the inter-annual variation in ANPP. In this note, we shaw that ca. one third of the unexplained variation is related to previous-year ANPP: ANPP per nun of precipitation was higher in years preceded by wet, more productive years than in years preceded by average years; similarly, ANPP per mm of precipitation was lower in years preceded by dry, less productive years than in years preceded by average years. Since previous-year ANPP was, in turn, associated with precipitation of a year before, current-year ANPP was also explained by precipitation of two previous years. Our finding not only increases our predictive ability, but it also changes our understanding of how ANPP responds to fluctuations in precipitation. If ANPP is thought to vary according to current-year precipitation only, it will simply track annual precipitation in time. According to this new result, however, ANPP fluctuations are buffered if wet, more productive years alternate with dry, less productive years, and they are amplified if wet or dry sequences of several years take place.},

abstract = {There are several factors that influence whether people will want to participate in index insurance programs. A number of these influence their attractiveness on economic grounds, including both the size and timing of the premium and potential payouts, and the degree of risk aversion of the potential customers. Other factors make programs attractive for reasons that are not economic, but no less valid. These have to do with the trust that people have in the insurance product and the organizations involved in selling and managing it. Indeed, data from India, Africa, and South America show that these factors may be more important than the economic ones in influencing demand. Index insurance pilot projects, in order to estimate demand for alternative products, have typically involved a great deal of interaction with potential customers. It is important to recognize that such interaction is crucial not just as a research tool, but also as a means to build understanding and trust in the products. When scaling up from isolated pilots to operational programs, it is vital to recognize this trust building function by replicating participation efforts in every community. In this paper, we examine the role of field games in establishing and building trust in three important aspects of these projects for participants: trust in the insurance product, trust in the participating organizations, and trust in their own ability to make good decisions. While games have previously been used as a way to gauge interest in the product and to identify design features, we argue that these games are also valuable tools for constructing these kinds of trust.},

The purpose of this paper is to address the issue of historical data availability in designing actuarially sound weather-based instruments. Design/methodology/approach – A Bayesian rainfall model utilizing spatial kriging and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques is proposed to estimate rainfall histories from observed historical data. An example drought insurance policy is presented where the fair rates are calculated using Monte Carlo methods and a historical analysis is carried out to assess potential policy performance. Findings – The applicability of the estimation method is validated using a rich data set from Iowa. Results from the historical analysis indicate that the systemic nature of weather risk can vary greatly over time, even in the relatively homogenous region of Iowa. Originality/value – The paper shows that while the kriging method may be more complex than competing models, it also provides a richer set of results. Furthermore, while the application is specific to forage production in Iowa, the rainfall model could be generalized to other regions by incorporating additional climatic factors.},

Increased biospheric warming is also projected to modify the amount and distribution of annual precipitation and increase the occurrence of both drought and heat waves.

abstract = {Considerable risk is present in today's ranching world; especially price and production risk. A producer who can tolerate more risk, and is knowledgeable about how to effectively manage price and production risk, may have opportunity to increase profitability relative to a highly risk averse producer. The purpose of this study is to investigate perceptions and sources of risk, identify how risk management is conducted, assess price and production risks, and view differences between producers' perceptions versus their attitudes towards risk and factors that affect risk. In order to investigate cow-calf producers' perceptions of risk, an instrument was created to survey beef cow-calf producers in the Kansas Farm Management Association (KFMA). Respondents provided information on their production practices, marketing methods, operating decisions and risk related to their cow-calf operations. A risk preference score for individual producers was developed from specific survey questions to determine three objectives: to classify producers' risk preferences related to their operating decisions; determine operating decisions that affect risk preferences; and identify what production and marketing practices in which producers were willing to risk for a chance to increase the net returns to their operations. A bi-directional causality between risk aversion and operation characteristics was illustrated between how operating decisions are related to risk aversion, and risk aversion is related to operating decisions. Factors that were found to influence risk aversion were socioeconomic factors such as age, off-farm income, debt-to-asset ratio, farm size, and number of cows owned, as well as comparative advantages of producer's: use and analysis of new technology, business planning skills and marketing skills. Models showing how risk aversionwas related to production management focused on producer's financial soundness, production practices and marketing methods, specific to retained ownership. Producers who would participate in value-added programs to increase returns to their operation have a comparative advantage in marketing skills, own more cattle, and are less diversified in terms of their farm enterprise incomes.},

abstract = {We analyze a dynamic and stochastic ecological–economic model of grazing management in semi-arid rangelands. The ecosystem is driven by stochastic precipitation. A risk averse farmer chooses a grazing management strategy under uncertainty such as to maximize expected utility from farming income. Grazing management strategies are rules about which share of the rangeland is given rest depending on the actual rainfall in that year. In a first step we determine a myopic farmer's optimal grazing management strategy and show that a risk averse farmer chooses a strategy such as to obtain insurance from the ecosystem: the optimal strategy reduces income variability, but yields less mean income than possible. In a second step we analyze the long-run ecological and economic impact of different strategies. We conclude that a myopic farmer, if he is sufficiently risk averse, will choose a sustainable grazing management strategy, even if he does not take into account long-term ecological and economic benefits of conservative strategies.},

abstract = {Effects of creep feeding calves are covered in this NebGuide. Gross income of the cow/calf enterprise is partially dependent on weaning weight of the calves. Three possible strategies can increase calf weaning weight if weaning date is not changed. They are to increase milk production of the dam, increase forage consumption of the calf, or provide supplemental feed to the calf to increase nutrient intake. Management practices exist to increase standing forage quality, but management of forages for the calf only can be difficult. Likewise, increasing milk production of the dam increases the nutrient requirements of the dam and reduces the number of cows that can graze a fixed nutrient resource base, and possibly result in a need for supplemental feed. Creep feeding studies consistently have shown an increase in weaning weight. Creep feeding of beef calves usually is reserved for certain market/management situations such as high calf prices, low feed prices, drylot operations, fall-born calves, and purebred bull calves. Because there are data that suggests noncreep fed calves catch up with their creep-fed mates post-weaning, the greatest return is realized if calves are sold at weaning. Under severe drought conditions, creep feeding can be used to sustain minimal calf growth. A risk of creep feeding is getting calves too fat, resulting in price discounts or lowered lifetime milk production of heifer calves intended to become replacements for the cow herd. Creep feeding must be carefully appraised in view of the economics of cost of gain, potential market, and the influence on sale price of calves. During drought conditions when cows are nursing calves, instead of creep feeding calves to sustain a targeted weight gain, producers should consider early weaning. Creep feeding calves in drought conditions does not result in lowered nutrient requirements of the dam. Data would suggest that creep fed calves still nurse. In drought conditions producers may want to consider early weaning the calves, especially if they have the facilities to feed lightweight calves, because they are very efficient at converting feed to weight gain. Information on this management alternative can be found in NebGuide G2047, Management of Early Weaned Calves. Nutrient Requirements and Ration Composition The dam supplies part of the nutrients needed for calf growth through her milk. For spring-born calves, milk and vegetative forage should allow for adequate weight gain. As Creep feeding calves gives an early start to eating grain, although care must be given that calves don't get too fat. the calf gets older, the amount of milk produced by the dam decreases and it becomes more difficult to meet the calf's nutrient needs. In addition, for spring calves, the quality of grass decreases in late summer and fall; again, there is usually insufficient protein or energy in the forage for optimum gain. If it is decided to creep feed calves nursing their dam, the ration must be energy and protein dense. This is because the rumen of the calf is small, so the calf will not eat a large amount of feed. As an example, for a 220-pound calf to gain 2.0 pounds per day, it must consume about 7 pounds of feed (milk, forages, plus creep feed) on a dry matter basis. The ration needs to supply 1.32 pounds of protein/day and 5.0 pounds of TDN/day (0.70 Mcal/lb NE m ; 0.44 Mcal/lb NE g). Example rations are in Table I. Table I. Examples of creep feed compositions},

abstract = {Rangelands cover more of Earth's land surface than any other type of land. They have variable and harsh climates, are sparsely populated and remote from markets, produce significant quantities of livestock, and are mostly used and managed in common. Under this already unpredictable and harsh climate, pastoral peoples and rangelands face new and accelerating political, economic, and climatic stresses that challenge their coupled resilience and ability to adapt. In response, pastoralists are creating new ways to manage rangelands through conservancies and community-based institutions on state, common, and private land. In this review, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of rangeland social-ecological systems, as well as on the causes and consequences of change in these systems. We then explore how pastoral peoples, governments, and businesses are responding to these changes to build resilience to sustain both pastoralism and rangelands. We close with a description of unresolved issues, challenges, and questions for the future.},

abstract = {The 'pulse-reserve' conceptual model--arguably one of the most-cited paradigms in aridland ecology--depicts a simple, direct relationship between rainfall, which triggers pulses of plant growth, and reserves of carbon and energy. While the heuristics of 'pulses', 'triggers' and 'reserves' are intuitive and thus appealing, the value of the paradigm is limited, both as a conceptual model of how pulsed water inputs are translated into primary production and as a framework for developing quantitative models. To overcome these limitations, we propose a revision of the pulse-reserve model that emphasizes the following: (1) what explicitly constitutes a biologically significant 'rainfall pulse', (2) how do rainfall pulses translate into usable 'soil moisture pulses', and (3) how are soil moisture pulses differentially utilized by various plant functional types (FTs) in terms of growth? We explore these questions using the patch arid lands simulation (PALS) model for sites in the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. Our analyses indicate that rainfall variability is best understood in terms of sequences of rainfall events that produce biologically-significant 'pulses' of soil moisture recharge, as opposed to individual rain events. In the desert regions investigated, biologically significant pulses of soil moisture occur in either winter (October-March) or summer (July-September), as determined by the period of activity of the plant FTs. Nevertheless, it is difficult to make generalizations regarding specific growth responses to moisture pulses, because of the strong effects of and interactions between precipitation, antecedent soil moisture, and plant FT responses, all of which vary among deserts and seasons. Our results further suggest that, in most soil types and in most seasons, there is little separation of soil water with depth. Thus, coexistence of plant FTs in a single patch as examined in this PALS study is likely to be fostered by factors that promote: (1) separation of water use over time (seasonal differences in growth), (2) relative differences in the utilization of water in the upper soil layers, or (3) separation in the responses of plant FTs as a function of preceding conditions, i.e., the physiological and morphological readiness of the plant for water-uptake and growth. Finally, the high seasonal and annual variability in soil water recharge and plant growth, which result from the complex interactions that occur as a result of rainfall variability, antecedent soil moisture conditions, nutrient availability, and plant FT composition and cover, call into question the use of simplified vegetation models in forecasting potential impacts of climate change in the arid zones in North America.},

A multi-period mathematical model is presented that estimates the outcomes of two common producer responses to changes in precipitation, partial liquidation and purchasing hay, given fluctuating cattle prices over a long term planning horizon. Results were further summarized with regression analysis and selected elasticities were calculated to reflect the sensitivity of outcomes to variability in precipitation and livestock prices. Although little impact was seen from utilizing additional hay as a strategy during drought, producers who follow this strategy are in a position to market more animals immediately post drought in general, resulting in better long run financial outcomes. Elasticity estimates suggest that profitability is more sensitive to variability in prices but that optimal choices of management strategies are more sensitive to variability in precipitation.},

abstract = {We use data from the administrative files of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency to examine how the dis- tribution of crop yields changed as individual farmers shifted into and out of the federal crop insurance program. The large panel fa- cilitates use of fixed effects that span each combination of farmer and production practice to account for unobserved differences in farmer abilities, risk preferences and soils, in addition to fixed ef- fects for interactions between all years and all counties to account for geographically-specific technological change, local prices, and weather. We also account for farm-specific yield variances. Con- ditional on this large set of fixed effects, we estimate the mean shift in yield and non-parametrically estimate the shift in the distribu- tion around the conditional mean associated with enrollment in crop insurance. Because differences between farmer and land types have been accounted for (i.e., controlling for adverse selection), the estimated shifts in yield distributions likely reflect moral hazard. For most crops in most states we find insurance is associated with statistically significant but small downward shifts in average yield. The largest shifts occur for cotton and rice, the highest-value of five crops considered. By integrating the estimated shift in yield distributions over actual indemnities paid, we provide estimates of the total indemnities paid due to moral hazard. Our results in- dicate moral hazard accounted for an estimated {\$}53.7 million in indemnities between 1992 and 2001, which amounts to 0.9{\%} of indemnities paid to the insured crops and states considered.},

abstract = {Global demand for livestock products is expected to double by 2050, mainly due to improvement in the worldwide standard of living. Meanwhile, climate change is a threat to livestock production because of the impact on quality of feed crop and forage, water availability, animal and milk production, livestock diseases, animal reproduction, and biodiversity. This study reviews the global impacts of climate change on livestock production, the contribution of livestock production to climate change, and specific climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the livestock sector. Livestock production will be limited by climate variability as animal water consumption is expected to increase by a factor of three, demand for agricultural lands increase due to need for 70{\%} growth in production, and food security concern since about one-third of the global cereal harvest is used for livestock feed. Meanwhile, the livestock sector contributes 14.5{\%} of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving further climate change. Consequently, the livestock sector will be a key player in the mitigation of GHG emissions and improving global food security. Therefore, in the transition to sustainable livestock production, there is a need for: a) assessments related to the use of adaptation and mitigation measures tailored to the location and livestock production system in use, and b) policies that support and facilitate the implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.},

abstract = {With expected increases in drought frequency and severity, long-term drought management strategies that focus on cattle selection and natural resource management are essential.The livestock industry in general unintentionally tends to select for cattle that do not perform to their maximum potential in limited-resource environments. We discuss the implications of cattle selection based on characteristics such as genetic potential, cow size, and hide color.In a hypothetical model, we found that because forage requirements for smaller cows are lower than forage requirements for larger cows, using a herd of smaller cows produces a larger total calf crop if cow size and milk do not lead to greater calf production.Because grazed forage remains the least expensive source of nutrients to maintain the cow herd, matching cow size and milk production potential to forage resources to optimize forage utilization and reproductive efficiency should be considered a rangeland drought mitigation strategy.Contemporary strategies such as using EPDs and selection indexes to manage maternal traits such as mature weight and maintenance energy requirements can be integrated with conventional drought mitigation strategies that focus on resource quality management.},

This evidence suggests that generally fire was most frequent during warm-dry periods as opposed to cool-moist periods. However, arid regions may see an increase of fire activity with an increase of moisture due to inherent fuel load limitations.•Using federal wildfire and weather data from 2002 to 2015 for New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, and Wyoming, we demonstrate that the worst wildfire activity occurred after average or above average precipitation years followed by drought in Oklahoma and Wyoming. Nevada wildfire activity was correlated with precipitation the preceding year, and New Mexico wildfire activity was not correlated with annual precipitation or preceding year precipitation.•The effects of future drought on fire intensity and severity are projected to be highly variable because they are both a function of fuel load. However, the potential for very large wildfires is predicted to increase; fire weather is expected to create hotter and drier conditions that start earlier and last longer; and the relative changes may be most noticeable in cooler regions that are of higher latitude and elevation.},

abstract = {The United States produces 41{\%} of the world's corn and 38{\%} of the world's soybeans. These crops comprise two of the four largest sources of caloric energy produced and are thus critical for world food supply. We pair a panel of county-level yields for these two crops, plus cotton (a warmer-weather crop), with a new fine-scale weather dataset that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the growing season. We find that yields increase with temperature up to 29° C for corn, 30° C for soybeans, and 32° C for cotton but that temperatures above these thresholds are very harmful. The slope of the decline above the optimum is significantly steeper than the incline below it. The same nonlinear and asymmetric relationship is found when we isolate either time-series or cross-sectional variations in temperatures and yields. This suggests limited historical adaptation of seed varieties or management practices to warmer temperatures because the cross-section includes farmers' adaptations to warmer climates and the time-series does not. Holding current growing regions fixed, area-weighted average yields are predicted to decrease by 30–46{\%} before the end of the century under the slowest (B1) warming scenario and decrease by 63–82{\%} under the most rapid warming scenario (A1FI) under the Hadley III model.},

abstract = {Soil properties that influence the capacity for infiltration and moisture retention are important determinants of rangeland productivity. Monitoring effects of grazing on dynamic soil properties can assist managers with stocking rate decisions, particularly if monitoring takes into account environmental variability associated with inherent soil morphological properties. On a Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie in northeast Oregon, we applied three cattle stocking rates (0.52, 1.04, and 1.56 animal unit months . ha(-1)) and an ungrazed control in a randomized complete block design for two 42-d grazing seasons and measured the change in four dynamic soil properties: soil penetration resistance, soil aggregate stability, bare ground, and herbaceous litter cover. To address apparent environmental heterogeneity within experimental units, we also utilized a categorical soil factor (termed Edaphic Habitat Types or EHT), determined by characterizing soil depth, texture, and rock fragment content at sample sites. Stocking rate did not affect extent of bare ground or soil aggregate stability. Stocking rate had a significant effect on penetration resistance, which was greatest at the high stocking rate (1.6 J . cm(-1) +/- 0.1 SE) and lowest in the control (1.1 J . cm(-1) +/- 0.1 SE). For litter cover, the effects of stocking rate and EHT interacted. In two rocky EHTs, litter cover was highest in the controls (60{\%} +/- 6 SE; 50{\%} +/- 3 SE) and ranged from 27{\%} +/- 3 SE to 33{\%} +/- 6 SE in the stocking rate treatments. Measures of penetration resistance, aggregate stability, and bare ground were different across EHTs regardless of stocking rate, but did not interact with stocking rate. Our study demonstrates that response of dynamic soil properties to stocking rates should be considered as a useful and accessible approach for monitoring effects of livestock management decisions on rangeland conditions.},

The results indicate that increases in temperature encourage farmers to adopt mixed farming and avoid, specialized farms such as crop-only or livestock-only farms, increases in precipitation encourage farmers to shift from irrigated to rainfed crops. As temperatures increase, farm incomes from crop-only farms or livestock-only farms fall whereas incomes from mixed farms increase. With precipitation increases, farm incomes from irrigated farms fall whereas incomes from rainfed farms increase. Naturally, the Structural Ricardian model predicts much smaller impacts than a model that holds farm type fixed. With a hot dry climate scenario, the Structural Ricardian model predicts that farm income will fall 50 percent but the fixed farm type model predicts farm incomes will fall 75 percent},

Tactics of taking no special action and of destocking the property's 14 600 sheep by 20{\%} and 40{\%} as soon as seasonal rains fail were considered. By examining all possible 10-year sequences of good, average or drought years, a tactic of substantial destocking was shown to have a better long-term expected economic return, with less variance, than a policy of hopeful inaction. A more detailed examination of drought sequences showed that at least 20{\%} immediate destocking is sensible if the drought lasts only 1 year but that 40{\%} is sensible if the drought lasts longer; given that the first year of drought can be recognised by the end of the winter growing season, 40{\%} destocking is economically worthwhile overall (regardless of ecological implications). A sensitivity analysis showed that, although the economic returns were sensitive to market prices for wool and for the animals sold during drought, the general result remained valid over a very wide range of market conditions for the property considered. On the basis of today's prices and costs, a policy of substantial immediate destocking in drought would also have been best in almost all of the decades of real weather records from 1885 to 1985, and is likely to become increasingly appropriate with forecast climatic change. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {CSIRO RANGEPACK is an evolving decision support system for the management of extensive grazing properties in the context of a variable climate and market. The system's modular tools are mainly microcomputer based. They include: programs such as HerdEcon, an integrating herd dynamics and property economics model; easily-used databases such as Climate, which provides ready access to meteorological data; and design tools such as Paddock, which assists managers to develop the spatial layout of their property. RANGEPACK philosophy includes the following: (i) decision support tools must be directed at significant management problems to be useful; users must be involved in establishing implementation priorities; (ii) a modular design allows important decisions to be targeted individually, and allows modules to be region specific: large process models of complex systems are obscure and difficult to interpret; (iii) it is important to make it easy for users to proceed by 'successive approximation': optimization techniques tend to obscure limitations in models; (iv) it must be possible to apply tools to specific properties and paddocks: managers do not like making decisions based on 'district averages'; (v) programming design should ensure ease of use, flexible communications between modules, and easy updating of modules; (vi) alternative media, such as wall charts and manuals, may be better than computers for some tasks, especially where microcomputer technology is not available.},

RangePack: system for managing grazing properties, in relation to the climate and the market. Uses HerdEcon, Climate, and Paddock

Decision support tools must be useful, users must have some form of input, and modularity - things must be able to be targeted separately. 

HerdEcon - herd and property economics/dynamic model
Climate - climatedata base with climatic variables -rainfall, temp
Paddock - helsp with desining paddocks, promotes even grazing pattern
Forage and Animal - Tackles issues of stocking rates. (note: not designed yet when this paper was written)

One you locate decision makers, their decisions have tbe analyzed - their short/long term applications, strategic/tactical decisions, etc.

"INformationa bout the district average...hypothetical unit is too easily dismissed....decision support systems must be made personal...adapted to mimic any property in considerable detail."},

abstract = {Agricultural insurance has been offered to farmers in many different countries in many different forms since at least the 1920s. The current U.S. agricultural insurance program, for example, is a mix of 22 different types of program (including area yield and revenue programs and rainfall and vegetation index based products as well as multiple peril revenue and yield products for individual farms) covering over 130 different crops. The US program is often cited as a model for other countries because of high participation by farmers. In 2008, the program achieved a record participation rate of just over 80 percent of the planted area eligible for insurance, about ten percent higher than in 2007 (Goodwin and Smith, 2009), but did so for two reasons. First, and most importantly, farmers did not have to pay any of the administration costs of the program (the loading factor is zero) and also had to pay only 40 percent of what were intended to be actuarially fair premium rates. Second, in 2008, to be eligible for U.S. crop disaster program payments, producers had to purchase agricultural insurance for all economically significant crops. As a result, agricultural insurance subsidy payments to U.S. farmers and crop insurance companies increased to almost {\$}6 billion. Clearly, most developing country governments cannot afford to provide this type of program to their countries' farm households....},

Three-hourly air and dew-point temperatures from 15 selected meteorological stations for the period 1990 to 1999 were used to compute values of the temperature/humidity index (THI). Maps of isolines of THI values were generated by geographical software. A THI {\textgreater} or = 84 was assumed to represent conditions where production losses would be likely to occur. Across the study area, the mean total number of days with THI {\textgreater} or = 84 was 56. However, there was a strong north to south gradient across the region. The results suggest that the highest risk of loss to production in the cattle and buffalo industries is in the southern part of this region.},

abstract = {Economic losses are incurred by the US livestock industries because farm animals are raised in locations and seasons where effective temperature conditions venture outside their zone of thermal comfort. The objective of this review was to estimate economic losses sustained by major US livestock industries from heat stress. Animal classes considered were: dairy cows, dairy heifers (0 to 1 yr and 1 to 2 yr), beef cows, finishing cattle, sows, market hogs, broilers, layers, and turkeys. Economic losses considered were: 1) decreased performance (feed intake, growth, milk, eggs), 2) increased mortality, and 3) decreased reproduction. USDA and industry data were used for monthly inventories of each animal class in each of the contiguous 48 states. Daily weather data from 257 weather stations over a range of 68 to 129 yr were used to estimate mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity, and their variances and covariances for each state. Animal responses were modeled from literature data using a combination of maximum temperature, humidity index, daily duration of heat stress, and a heat load index. Monte Carlo techniques were used to simulate 1000 times the weather for each month of the year, for each animal class, for each state, and for each of four intensities of heat abatement (minimum, moderate, high, and intensive). Capital and operating costs were accounted for each heat abatement intensity. Without heat abatement (minimum intensity), total losses across animal classes averaged {\$}2.4 billion annually. Optimum heat abatement intensity reduced annual total losses to {\$}1.7 billion. Annual losses averaged {\$}897 million, {\$}369 million, {\$}299 million, and {\$}128 million for dairy, beef, swine, and poultry industries, respectively. Across states, Texas, California, Oklahoma, Nebraska, and North Carolina accounted for {\$}728 million of annual losses, or 43{\%} of total national losses. Results point to a need for more energy and capital efficient heat abatement systems.},

abstract = {Recommended strategies for dealing with drought include maintaining a conservative stocking rate, maintaining grazing flexibility by having yearlings as one of multiple enterprises on the ranch, and leaving a significant amount of herbaceous production at the end of the grazing season. We perform an economic analysis of these grazing strategies using a bio-economic multiperiod linear programming model with variable annual forage production and beef prices. We evaluate the economics of conservative versus flexible grazing where stock numbers are adjusted to match forage conditions. The deterministic model estimates that a flexible grazing strategy could nearly double net returns relative to a conservative strategy, but realizing this substantial economic potential means higher production costs, and it depends on a quality climate forecast that is not currently available. Maintaining grazing flexibility was determined to be very important for managing variable forage conditions, and its importance increased with the level of variability. Without annual variation in forage production, over 80{\%} of available forage would optimally be allocated to cow calf production. As forage variability increased to levels observed on the arid rangelands of the western United States, a 50:50 forage allocation between cow calf and yearling enterprises was found to be optimal, but optimal cow numbers decreased over time as dry conditions force herd reductions. As compared to a cow calf ranch only, adding flexible yearling enterprises increased average annual net ranch returns by 14{\%} with conservative stocking and by up to 66{\%} with flexible grazing. Herd expansion beyond a conservative level should occur with yearlings because adjusting cow numbers is too expensive relative to the potential short-term gain, even if forage conditions are known with certainty.

We propose that in drylands, the dynamics of ecosystem state change are determined by changes in the type (stabilizing vs amplifying) and strength of ecohydrological feedbacks following a change in exogenous forces. Using a selection of five case studies from drylands, we explore the characteristics of ecohydrological feedbacks and resulting dynamics of ecosystem state change. We surmise that stabilizing feedbacks are critical for the provision of plantessential resources in drylands. Exogenous forces that break these stabilizing feedbacks can alter the state of the system, although such changes are potentially reversible if strong amplifying ecohydrological feedbacks do not develop. The case studies indicate that if amplifying ecohydrological feedbacks do develop, they are typically associated with abiotic processes such as runoff, erosion (by wind and water), and fire. These amplifying ecohydrological feedbacks progressively modify the system in ways that are long-lasting and possibly irreversible on human timescales.},

These characteristics are delineated and discussed using examples from individual projects and programs. From this, three principal lessons leading to successful efforts emerge that address co-design, adaptive or flexible management, and diversity of knowledge. In addition, five challenges for this science are identified: accounting for change, addressing sponsorship and timelines, appreciating different knowledge systems, adaptively communicating, and improving linkages to policy.},

abstract = {AbstractIndex insurance is becoming increasingly popular because of its ability to provide low-cost, relatively easy to implement agricultural insurance for vegetation types whose productivity has been notoriously difficult to measure and to farmers in less-developed nations where traditional crop insurance schemes are not reasonable to implement. This study examines if the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be an effective basis for index-based crop insurance over a diverse set of locations. To do this the authors compare Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) values to cumulative precipitation, extreme heat, and crop yields for 60 locations across the United States for the years 1982–2003. Quadratic regression equations are used to explore these relationships. The findings suggest that the relationship between NDVI, precipitation, extreme heat, and crop yields is highly variable and dependent on location-specific characteristics.

abstract = {The Livestock Gross Margin Insurance for Dairy Cattle is a federally reinsured insurance program that enables US dairy producers to establish minimum levels of milk income net of feed cost. Given the structure of this program there are an infinite number of possible contract designs based on the choice of deductible level and proportion of production insured. Adding to this complexity, producers vary in their risk preferences, which affect the incentive to insure their margin. It is unclear as to how producers may adopt this program for revenue risk management. This paper investigates the interplay between producer risk preferences, contract design and the subsidization of premium in determining program coverage. We undertook this analysis within an expected utility framework. Optimal contracts under different rates of constant relative rate of risk aversion and subsidies were analyzed using a nonlinear optimization model. We found that total optimal coverage increased significantly with the level of risk of aversion at lower deductibles but as deductible level increased, the level of risk aversion had a lesser impact on total optimal coverages. As expected, at the same deductible and risk aversion levels, inclusion of a premium subsidy increased the total optimal coverage. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

For this purpose, they compare the performance of several drought indices [the standardized precipitation index (SPI); four versions of the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI); and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)] to predict changes in streamflow, soil moisture, forest growth, and crop yield. The authors found a superior capability of the SPEI and the SPI drought indices, which are calculated on different time scales than the Palmer indices to capture the drought impacts on the aforementioned hydrological, agricultural, and ecological variables. They detected small differences in the comparative performance of the SPI and the SPEI indices, but the SPEI was the drought index that best captured the responses of the assessed variables to drought in summer, the season in which more drought-related impacts are recorded and in which drought monitoring is critical. Hence, the SPEI shows improved capability to identify drought impacts as compared with the SPI. In conclusion, it seems reasonable to recommend the use of the SPEI if the responses of the variables of interest to drought are not known a priori.},

abstract = {The concept of resilience has evolved considerably since Holling's (1973) seminal paper. Different interpretations of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion. Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system's dynamics. Three related attributes of social– ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components—latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy—most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social structures make the existing system untenable. The implications of this interpretation of SES dynamics for sustainability science include changing the focus from seeking optimal states and the determinants of maximum sustainable yield (the MSY paradigm), to resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance.},

Biweekly climate maps precipitation and temperature) were constructed by interpolation of weather station measurements. Maps of biweekly growing season (March to October) NDVI were constructed for Kansas using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI images. Average precipitation is a strong predictor of the major east-west NDVI gradient. Deviation from average precipitation explained most of the year-to-year variation in spatial patterns. NDVI and precipitation covaried in the same direction (both positive or both negative) for 60-95{\%} of the total land area. Minimum and average temperatures were positively correlated with NDVI, but temperature deviation from average was generally not correlated with NDVI deviation from average. Our results demonstrate that precipitation is a strong predictor of regional spatial patterns of NDVI and, by inference, patterns of productivity.},

abstract = {To prepare agricultural systems for climate change, scientists need to be able to effectively engage with land managers and policy makers to explore potential solutions. An ongoing challenge in engagement is to distil the complexity of climate-change-management-change interactions in agro-ecological systems to identify responses that are most important for adaptation planning. This paper presents an approach for selecting climate change scenarios to provide a focal point for engaging with stakeholders to evaluate adaptation options and communicate assessment outcomes. We illustrate how scenarios selected with the approach can be used by evaluating climate change impacts and an adaptation option for livestock industries in the north-east Australian rangelands. Climate change impacts on forage production, animal liveweight gain and soil loss are found to track projected climate changes in four pasture communities; increasing by up to 50{\%} and declining by up to 110{\%} in response to doubled atmospheric carbon-dioxide (CO2), 4°C warming, and +20{\%} to −40{\%} changes in mean annual rainfall. The effectiveness of reducing grazing pressure as an adaptation option shows a similar response; resulting in higher forage production (up to 40{\%}), animal liveweight gains (up to 59{\%}) and gross margins (up to 40{\%}), and reduced soil erosion (down by 91{\%}) per hectare relative to the baseline management. The results show that a few key scenarios may be selected to represent the range of global climate model (GCM) projections for use in assessing and communicating impacts and adaptation; simplifying the assessments and allowing limits to the effectiveness of adaptation options to be explored. The approach provides a framework for capturing and communicating trends in climate change impacts and the utility of options, which are required for successful engagement of stakeholders in finding viable adaption responses.},

abstract = {Logging is a larger cause of adult tree mortality in northeastern U.S. forests than all other causes of mortality combined. We used Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to develop statistical models to quantify three different aspects of aggregate regional forest harvest regimes: (1) the annual probability that a plot is logged, as a function of total aboveground tree biomass, (2) the fraction of adult tree basal area removed if a plot was logged, and (3) the probability that an individual tree within a plot was removed, as a function of the fraction of basal area removed at the plot level, the species of tree, and its size. Results confirm that relatively frequent partial harvesting dominates the logging regimes, but with significant variation among different parts of the region and different forest types. The harvest regimes have similarities with natural disturbance regimes in imposing spatially and temporally dynamic mortality that varies predictably as a function of stand structure as well as tree species and size.},

abstract = {During the last one hundred years, Kenya's Maasailand has seen the passage of significant milestones such as the rinderpest epidemic, colonialism, agreements with the authorities, land alienation, independence, more land alienation, national park development and land conversion into agriculture. Nomadic pastoralism is a highly evolved production system, which, among the Maasai, has reached a specialised form. Pastoralists living in dryland areas have evolved a set of strategies to deal with uncertainty in rainfall and the supply of forage, and which have, until recently, allowed them to survive in those non-equilibrium areas. These environments require flexibility in range management. In traditional systems, nomadic pastoralists make decisions based on a complex set of variables. But nomadic pastoralists in Kenya and the Maasai in particular, have seen radical changes in their environment in the last one hundred years. The pace of change has accelerated in the last 30 years. Much of the change is due to the loss of resources, which has limited the choices they would normally have in the management of their livestock. These limitations become especially debilitating during times of intensified drought. Environmental changes (natural and anthropogenic) have increased the vulnerability of the Maasai pastoral populations, by reducing their resource base (land as well as livestock), and making it very difficult for them to survive on subsistence pastoralism. At present, they are particularly vulnerable to any intensifiesd droughts and are insecure in terms of poverty, food security health, socio-economic losses and sometimes to civil strife and conflicts.},

A research priority in the emerging science of ecohydrology is an improved understanding of the implications of vegetation change for the water cycle. This paper describes some of the interactions between vegetation and water on rangelands and poses 3 questions that represent high-priority, emerging issues: 1) How do changes in woody plants affect water yield? 2) What are the ecohydrological consequences of invasion by exotic plants? 3) What ecohydrological feedbacks play a role in rangeland degradation processes? To effectively address these questions, we must expand our knowledge of hydrological connectivity and how it changes with scale, accurately identify "hydrologically sensitive" areas on the landscape, carry out detailed studies to learn where plants are accessing water, and investigate feedback loops between vegetation and the water cycle.},

abstract = {Old World Bluestems, such as yellow bluestem (. Bothriochloa ischaemum), have been seeded extensively in the Southern Great Plains because they are responsive to nitrogen fertilization and allow for higher stocking rates. From 1991 to 2005, we measured the effects of moderately grazing prairie species and heavily grazing fertilized yellow bluestem on runoff, sediment yield, leaf litter cover, and aboveground plant biomass for four adjacent watersheds located at the USDA-ARS Southern Plains Range Research Station in the sub-humid Rolling Red Plains of western Oklahoma. Here we show that factors other than leaf litter cover and biomass determine variation in runoff when leaf litter exceeds 70{\%}. Runoff was related to grazing rate and storm size and inversely related to storm duration. Rainfall thresholds were similar between the moderately grazed prairie watersheds (15. mm) and the heavily grazed yellow bluestem watersheds (18. mm); however, the slope of the rainfall-runoff curve from heavily grazed yellow bluestem (0.242) was steeper than that of moderately grazed prairie (0.087). Slightly higher runoff from heavily grazed yellow bluestem relative to moderately grazed prairie may occur due to compaction of both the leaf litter and topsoil. Sediment yield was low from moderately grazed native prairie and heavily grazed yellow bluestem. Our findings indicate that both treatments assessed appear hydrologically sustainable. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

This study investigates several dimensions of weather basis risk for the U.S. corn market at various levels of aggregation. The results suggest that while the degree of geographic basis risk may be significant in some instances, it should not preclude the use of geographic cross-hedging. In addition, the degree to which geographic basis risk impedes effective hedging diminishes as the level of spatial aggregation increases. In fact, geographic basis risk is actually negative in the case most representative of a reinsurance hedge, and the reduction in risk from employing straightforward temperature derivatives is significant. Finally, precipitation hedges are found to introduce additional product basis risk. The findings may be of interest to decision makers considering using exchange traded weather derivatives to hedge agricultural production and insurance risk.},

In contrast to earlier studies which investigate the problem at low levels of aggregation, we find that better weather hedging opportunities may exist at higher levels of spatial aggregation. Aggregating production exposures reduces idiosyncratic risk, leaving a greater proportion of the total risk in the form of systemic weather risk which can be effectively hedged using relatively simple weather derivatives. The aggregation effect suggests that the potential for weather derivatives in agriculture may be greater than previously thought, particularly for aggregators of risk such as reinsurers.},

However, the relationship between the interannual variation in ANPP and the variability in precipitation remains controversial. In this study, we used long-term data of biomass and precipitation from 118 sites across global grasslands to examine the relationship between variability in ANPP and AP. Our results showed that ANPP increased with precipitation, but leveled off in humid regions, and that increased variation in precipitation led to an increase in the variability in ANPP. The relative ANPP maxima significantly increased with relative AP maxima and the relative ANPP minima also positively correlated with relative AP minima. These suggest that the fluctuations in precipitation can alter the growth of grasslands, which should be incorporated into the prediction and modeling of climate changes.},

abstract = {Drought is a stochastic natural hazard that is instigated by intense and persistent shortage of precipitation. Follow- ing an initial meteorological phenomenon, subsequent impacts are realized on agriculture and hydrology. Among the natural hazards, droughts possess certain unique features; in addition to delayed effects, droughts vary by multiple dynamic dimen- sions including severity and duration, which in addition to causing a pervasive and subjective network of impacts makes them difficult to characterize. In order manage drought, drought characterization is essential enabling both retrospective analyses (e.g., severity versus impacts analysis) and prospective planning (e.g., risk assessment). The adaptation of a simpli- fied method by drought indices has facilitated drought characterization for various users and entities. More than 100 drought indices have so far been proposed, some of which are operationally used to characterize drought using gridded maps at re- gional and national levels. These indices correspond to different types of drought, including meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological drought. By quantifying severity levels and declaring drought's start and end, drought indices currently aid in a variety of operations including drought early warning and monitoring and contingency planning. Given their variety and ongoing development, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive overview of available drought indices that highlights their difference and examines the trend in their development. This paper reviews 74 operational and proposed drought indi- ces and describes research directions.},

abstract = {In this study, an ecohydrological Cellular Automata Tree-Grass-Shrub Simulator (CATGraSS) is presented. CATGraSS is driven by pulses of rainfall and daily solar radiation. In the model, each cell can hold a single plant type (tree, shrub, tree seedlings, shrub seedlings, grass) or can be bare soil. Plant competition is modeled explicitly by keeping track of mortality and establishment of plants, both calculated probabilistically based on soil moisture stress. Topographic influence on incoming shortwave radiation is treated explicitly, which leads to spatial variations in potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture over storm and interstorm time scales, and plant distribution over annual time scales. The model is implemented in a small basin (3.3 km2) in central New Mexico, USA, where north facing slopes are characterized by a juniper pine and grass savanna, and south facing slopes by creosotebush shrubs and grasses. Representing the current climate by a seasonal-varying Poisson rectangular pulse rainfall model, CATGraSS is calibrated against the existing plant patterns in the study catchment. The model is then used in a series of numerical experiments. CATGraSS is first run on flat terrain to examine the role of topography on plant patterns. Consistent with our observation in the region, this “flat run” gave a shrubland ecosystem with scattered grasses and trees. Model sensitivity to rainfall is investigated in a limited number of simulations by altering rainfall frequency-magnitude statistics, and seasonality. The sensitivity runs suggest that changes in the storm characteristics could lead to a dramatic reorganization of the plant composition on topography in central New Mexico. CATGraSS results underscore the importance of solar irradiance in determining vegetation composition over complex terrain under a water-limited ecosystem.},

abstract = {Neural network ensemble is a learning paradigm where many neural networks are jointly used to solve a problem. In this paper, the relationship between the ensemble and its component neural networks is analyzed from the context of both regression and classification, which reveals that it may be better to ensemble many instead of all of the neural networks at hand. This result is interesting because at present, most approaches ensemble all the available neural networks for prediction. Then, in order to show that the appropriate neural networks for composing an ensemble can be effectively selected from a set of available neural networks, an approach named GASEN is presented. GASEN trains a number of neural networks at first. Then it assigns random weights to those networks and employs genetic algorithm to evolve the weights so that they can characterize to some extent the fitness of the neural networks in constituting an ensemble. Finally it selects some neural networks based on the evolved weights to make up the ensemble. A large empirical study shows that, compared with some popular ensemble approaches such as Bagging and Boosting, GASEN can generate neural network ensembles with far smaller sizes but stronger generalization ability. Furthermore, in order to understand the working mechanism of GASEN, the bias-variance decomposition of the error is provided in this paper, which shows that the success of GASEN may lie in that it can significantly reduce the bias as well as the variance. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
